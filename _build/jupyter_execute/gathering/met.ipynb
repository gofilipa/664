    "# the MET API\n",
    "## the anatomy of a URL\n",
    "My favorite API is the [Met API](https://metmuseum.github.io/), from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. I like this API because it is free, open, and requires no sign-up or authentication codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "To give more of a sense of how an API gets data from a server, I will explain the \"anatomy\" of a URL. APIs use URL *endpoints* to get data from servers. You can think of a URL as a series of folders that each contain data. The folder which contains the data you want is the endpoint. Here's how the Met uses URLs in its API:\n",
    "- the *root* consists of the base URL. \n",
    "   - https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/\n",
    "- the *path* which consists of a directory structure (file structure) where the data is held: \n",
    "   - /public/collection/v1/objects\n",
    "   - /public/collection/v1/departments \n",
    "   - /public/collection/v1/search\n",
    "- the *query parameter* or the *endpoint* which is the specific request.\n",
    "   - ?q=SearchTerm\n",
    "   - ?q=Berthe+Morisot\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to search for objects that match the name of the painter \"Berthe Morisot,\" one would use the following request URL:\n",
    "`https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/search?q=Berthe+Morisot`\n",
    "\n",
    "The results would appear as a list of object IDs in a JSON format. Then, one would use the objects path to search for a specific object. The result is the catalog information for that item in JSON format. Put the above URL in the browser to see it for yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "`https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/objects/438009`\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the workshop, we will look more deeply at the [Legiscan API](https://legiscan.com/legiscan). "
