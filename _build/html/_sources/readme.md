# Introduction to Python for Programming Cultural Heritage
By Filipa Calado

Pratt Institute School of Information

## Welcome to Programming for Cultural Heritage!
This website offers a series of Python lessons organized into
different sections, like "Introduction to Python Fundamentals" and
"Python for Data Cleaning". These materials introduce participants to
the Python programming language for working in cultural heritage
contexts like libraries, archives, and museums.


### Section overviews
**1: “Introduction to Python Fundamentals”**
- Offers basic
  introduction to core concepts in Python programming, grounded in a
  critical awareness about data and what happens to data at various
  levels of transformation and abstraction.

**2: “Python for Web Scraping and APIs”**
- Introduction to ethics, legality, and programmatic methods for
  extracting data from the web. Advances core concepts from
  introductory session (like loops and conditional statements) and
  adds new concepts on object-oriented programming and working with
  Python libraries. Participants practice scraping metadata from
  current “anti-trans” bills in the USA.
- libraries: `requests`, `bs4`, and `pandas`

**3: “Python for Data Cleaning”**
- Experiments with approaches for wrangling
  text data into formats for analysis, with emphasis on removing unwanted
  elements that may skew analysis. While building on skills
  for writing loops and conditional statements and working with
  external libraries, participants will learn to write functions and
  scripts for running customized text cleaning processes.  
- libraries: `pandas`, `spacy`

**4: “Python for Data Analysis”**
- Explores methods for finding and analyzing textual patterns through popular tasks in Natural
  Language Processing. Participants practice writing code to annotate
  and extract text according to specific features from current
  “anti-trans” bills in the USA.
- libraries: `spaCy`
  
**5: “Python for Machine Learning”**
- With the anti-trans bills data that they prepared in previous workshops, participants practice fine-tuning a small Text Generation model and learn about how to use Machine Learning for research.
- libraries: `transformers`

**6: "Python for Publishing"
- For this session, we will learn Jekyll and Github Pages to deploy
  your project into a website that others can access on the internet.

Research Institute [Python workshop](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/python). 

The opening challenge takes text from the [Feminist Data Manifest-No](https://www.manifestno.com/) by M. Cifor, P. Garcia, et al.

Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html)

All of the above workshops were first developed and piloted at the
Princeton University Library in the 2023-2024 academic year. Thank you
to Princeton students, faculty, and staff for their generous
participation and suggestions.
