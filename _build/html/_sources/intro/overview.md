# chapter overview

## learning objectives
This chapter explores how the Python programming language takes data, organizes it into collections or groupings, with the goal of doing something to that data. 

It introduces:

- data types and variables for categorizing and saving data
- functions and methods for working with data
- iterative and logical structures
- basic Python syntax

## Python environments

There are many ways to use Python. For this workshop, we will be using
[Jupyter-Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), installed through the
[Python Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)
distrubtion. This option is convenient because it creates a "local"
version of Python directly on your computer, which means you can use
it in mutiple ways and without an internet connection.

For those of you who cannot download Python, you can use [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), a browser-based tool for
running Python code. Like Google Docs, Google Colab creates a
collaborative environment hosted on the Google cloud for authoring
content. Whereas most Python environments require installations (some
of which can be really complicated), Google Colab offers Python
software pre-installed on the cloud environment. It enables new users
to jump right into programming.
