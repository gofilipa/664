<p>In this section we will clean the bill text that we scraped from the last section. We will do this in the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>get our text (if we don’t already have it loaded up) from either scraping or loading the file from the previous section.</p></li>
<li><p>inspect our text to identify elements that we want to clean</p></li>
<li><p>write loops to remove these elements from the text</p></li>
<li><p>learn about functions so we can write one to clean our text in an automatic way</p></li>
<li><p>keep improving the funtion to clean more and more elements</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Then, at the end, we will look at other tools (ChatGPT and OpenRefine) to help with the cleaning process.</p>

<h2>function to automate cleaning<a class="headerlink" href="#function-to-automate-cleaning" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Let’s say we want to do this to many bits of text, not just one. We could automate the work by writing a function that can run on as many texts as we want.</p>
<p>Functions have two key components: the definition and the call. You first define the function and what it does, then you “call” it to get it to work on a particular piece of data.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the definition. First, you name the function, and include parentheses for your parameters (more on this in a moment). Then, in the body of the definition, you write whatever python code you want to execute for that function. Finally, you have a return statement that saves or “returns” the result, so to speak, from the function.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">

    <span class="n">answer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">y</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">answer</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then we call the function.</p>

<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10021</span><span class="p">)</span>

<div class="cell_output docutils container">
<div class="output text_plain highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>10026
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The basic idea is that the input data, whatever data you want the function to work with, goes inside the parentheses. So that within the body of the function definition, that input data (known formally as “parameters”) gets assigned to whatever variable is in the definition.</p>
<p>This makes functions portable, so to speak, as you can write one, then call it using whatever input data that you like.</p>
<p>What would a function for our text cleaner look like?</p>

SHORT TITLE.This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Democracy in Burma Act of 2021&#39;&#39;.SEC. 2. FINDINGS.Congress finds the following:(1) On March 14, 2005, the House of Representatives agreed to H. Res. 135, which established the House Democracy Assistance Commission (later changed to the House Democracy Partnership, hereafter referred to as ``HDP&#39;&#39;) to work directly with parliaments around the world to support the development of effective, independent, and responsive legislative institutions.(2) HDP approved a legislative strengthening partnership with Burma in 2016 and organized the first congressional delegation to meet with the new civilian-led government, led by State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, and civil society leaders in May 2016.(3) On February 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of State assessed that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma&#39;s ruling party, and President Win Myint, the duly elected head of government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1, 2021.(4) As part of the military coup, the Burmese military declared martial law, suspended the civilian-led government, and detained newly elected Members of Parliament in the capitol, Naypyidaw, thereby usurping the role of the democratically elected government and parliament.SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.It is the sense of Congress that--(1) due to the Burmese military&#39;s seizure of government through the detention of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and other government leaders, Burma is not represented by a democratically elected government;(2) the inability of newly elected Members of Parliament to begin their official mandate due to the Burmese military&#39;s actions directly threatens the democratic trajectory of Burma&#39;s Parliament, and thereby the country;(3) the will and determination of those duly-elected Members of Parliament who are taking it upon themselves to continue serving as representatives of the people through alternative methods of communicating and convening should be lauded; and(4) by preventing the Parliament from completing its work, the Burmese military has rendered impossible and effectively nullified the international collaborative relationships that have supported and strengthened the institution, including the Burmese parliament&#39;s partnership with HDP.SEC. 4.

R. 886 To provide funds through the Social Services Block Grant program fordiaper assistance.IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESFebruary 5, 2021Ms. Lee of California (for herself, Mr. Rush, Mr. Carson, Ms. Meng, Mr. Sires, and Mrs. Hayes) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means A BILLTo provide funds through the Social Services Block Grant program fordiaper assistance.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 Diaper Assistance Act&#39;&#39;.SEC. 2. FINDINGS.Congress finds the following:(1) Infants need between 6 to 12 diapers a day. Infants and toddlers lacking access to clean diapers have a greater risk for health complications, which require costly and difficult to access medical care.(2) Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, surveys indicated that 1 in 3 families in the United States with young children could not afford an adequate supply of diapers to keep their child clean, dry, and healthy.(3) Low-income families pay an even higher than average price for diapers because they do not have access to money saving alternatives such as bulk buying or online shopping that can reduce costs. Low-income families spend about 14 percent of their income on diapers.(4) Clean diaper access presents a financial and stressful burden on families&#39; dependent on child care services. Research indicates that when diaper need is a barrier to child care, parents miss an average of 4 workdays a month.(5) The COVID-19 pandemic has further raised demand for diapers and strained diaper banks&#39; ability to meet low-income families&#39; needs. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, nonprofit diaper bank distribution only met 5 to 6 percent of diaper need. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, diaper banks around the country have experienced double, triple, or greater increase in demand for diapers due to the pandemic and economic shutdown. Nonprofits alone cannot fully address this public health crisis that impacts 1 in 3 families in the United States.SEC. 3.

R. 1112 To require a report on the military coup in Burma, and for otherpurposes.IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 18, 2021Mr. Connolly (for himself, Mr. Price of North Carolina, and Mr. Buchanan) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs A BILLTo require a report on the military coup in Burma, and for otherpurposes.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Democracy in Burma Act of 2021&#39;&#39;.SEC. 2. FINDINGS.Congress finds the following:(1) On March 14, 2005, the House of Representatives agreed to H. Res. 135, which established the House Democracy Assistance Commission (later changed to the House Democracy Partnership, hereafter referred to as ``HDP&#39;&#39;) to work directly with parliaments around the world to support the development of effective, independent, and responsive legislative institutions.(2) HDP approved a legislative strengthening partnership with Burma in 2016 and organized the first congressional delegation to meet with the new civilian-led government, led by State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, and civil society leaders in May 2016.(3) On February 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of State assessed that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma&#39;s ruling party, and President Win Myint, the duly elected head of government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1, 2021.(4) As part of the military coup, the Burmese military declared martial law, suspended the civilian-led government, and detained newly elected Members of Parliament in the capitol, Naypyidaw, thereby usurping the role of the democratically elected government and parliament.SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.It is the sense of Congress that--(1) due to the Burmese military&#39;s seizure of government through the detention of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and other government leaders, Burma is not represented by a democratically elected government;(2) the inability of newly elected Members of Parliament to begin their official mandate due to the Burmese military&#39;s actions directly threatens the democratic trajectory of Burma&#39;s Parliament, and thereby the country;(3) the will and determination of those duly-elected Members of Parliament who are taking it upon themselves to continue serving as representatives of the people through alternative methods of communicating and convening should be lauded; and(4) by preventing the Parliament from completing its work, the Burmese military has rendered impossible and effectively nullified the international collaborative relationships that have supported and strengthened the institution, including the Burmese parliament&#39;s partnership with HDP.SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.It is the policy of the United States to--(1) engage with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN member states to--(A) condemn the military coup in Burma;(B) urge the unconditional release of detained democratically elected leaders and civil society members; and(C) support a return to Burma&#39;s democratic transition; and(2) instruct, as appropriate, representatives of the United States Government to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to hold accountable those responsible for the military coup in Burma.SEC. 5.

R. 1112 To require a report on the military coup in Burma, and for other purposes. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 18, 2021 Mr. Connolly (for himself, Mr. Price of North Carolina, and Mr. Buchanan) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To require a report on the military coup in Burma, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Democracy in Burma Act of 2021&#39;&#39;. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) On March 14, 2005, the House of Representatives agreed to H. Res. 135, which established the House Democracy Assistance Commission (later changed to the House Democracy Partnership, hereafter referred to as ``HDP&#39;&#39;) to work directly with parliaments around the world to support the development of effective, independent, and responsive legislative institutions. (2) HDP approved a legislative strengthening partnership with Burma in 2016 and organized the first congressional delegation to meet with the new civilian-led government, led by State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, and civil society leaders in May 2016. (3) On February 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of State assessed that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma&#39;s ruling party, and President Win Myint, the duly elected head of government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1, 2021. (4) As part of the military coup, the Burmese military declared martial law, suspended the civilian-led government, and detained newly elected Members of Parliament in the capitol, Naypyidaw, thereby usurping the role of the democratically elected government and parliament. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) due to the Burmese military&#39;s seizure of government through the detention of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and other government leaders, Burma is not represented by a democratically elected government; (2) the inability of newly elected Members of Parliament to begin their official mandate due to the Burmese military&#39;s actions directly threatens the democratic trajectory of Burma&#39;s Parliament, and thereby the country; (3) the will and determination of those duly-elected Members of Parliament who are taking it upon themselves to continue serving as representatives of the people through alternative methods of communicating and convening should be lauded; and (4) by preventing the Parliament from completing its work, the Burmese military has rendered impossible and effectively nullified the international collaborative relationships that have supported and strengthened the institution, including the Burmese parliament&#39;s partnership with HDP. SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. It is the policy of the United States to-- (1) engage with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN member states to-- (A) condemn the military coup in Burma; (B) urge the unconditional release of detained democratically elected leaders and civil society members; and (C) support a return to Burma&#39;s democratic transition; and (2) instruct, as appropriate, representatives of the United States Government to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to hold accountable those responsible for the military coup in Burma. SEC. 5. REPORT. Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a report on the military coup in Burma, including a description of efforts to implement the policy specified in section 4. &lt;all&gt;&quot;

 &#39;text&#39;: &quot;[Congressional Bills 117th Congress] [From the U.S. Government Publishing Office] [H.R. 1112 Introduced in House (IH)]\n\n&lt;DOC&gt; 117th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 1112 To require a report on the military coup in Burma, and for other purposes. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 18, 2021 Mr. Connolly (for himself, Mr. Price of North Carolina, and Mr. Buchanan) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To require a report on the military coup in Burma, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Democracy in Burma Act of 2021&#39;&#39;. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) On March 14, 2005, the House of Representatives agreed to H. Res. 135, which established the House Democracy Assistance Commission (later changed to the House Democracy Partnership, hereafter referred to as ``HDP&#39;&#39;) to work directly with parliaments around the world to support the development of effective, independent, and responsive legislative institutions. (2) HDP approved a legislative strengthening partnership with Burma in 2016 and organized the first congressional delegation to meet with the new civilian-led government, led by State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, and civil society leaders in May 2016. (3) On February 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of State assessed that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma&#39;s ruling party, and President Win Myint, the duly elected head of government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1, 2021. (4) As part of the military coup, the Burmese military declared martial law, suspended the civilian-led government, and detained newly elected Members of Parliament in the capitol, Naypyidaw, thereby usurping the role of the democratically elected government and parliament. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) due to the Burmese military&#39;s seizure of government through the detention of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and other government leaders, Burma is not represented by a democratically elected government; (2) the inability of newly elected Members of Parliament to begin their official mandate due to the Burmese military&#39;s actions directly threatens the democratic trajectory of Burma&#39;s Parliament, and thereby the country; (3) the will and determination of those duly-elected Members of Parliament who are taking it upon themselves to continue serving as representatives of the people through alternative methods of communicating and convening should be lauded; and (4) by preventing the Parliament from completing its work, the Burmese military has rendered impossible and effectively nullified the international collaborative relationships that have supported and strengthened the institution, including the Burmese parliament&#39;s partnership with HDP. SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. It is the policy of the United States to-- (1) engage with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN member states to-- (A) condemn the military coup in Burma; (B) urge the unconditional release of detained democratically elected leaders and civil society members; and (C) support a return to Burma&#39;s democratic transition; and (2) instruct, as appropriate, representatives of the United States Government to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to hold accountable those responsible for the military coup in Burma. SEC. 5. REPORT. Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a report on the military coup in Burma, including a description of efforts to implement the policy specified in section 4. &lt;all&gt;&quot;}

<h2>cleaning tabular data with OpenRefine<a class="headerlink" href="#cleaning-tabular-data-with-openrefine" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a> is an open source GUI tool for working with tabular data. It is especially useful for cleaning and organizing spreadsheet data.</p>
<p>We are going to use this tool to clean the “Title” column in our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trans.csv</span></code> dataset.</p>
<p>First, download and install the app. <a class="reference external" href="https://openrefine.org/download">Download here</a>.</p>
<p>After installing, when you open the app, it will appear on your browser, like Jupyter Notebooks.</p>
<p>Second, we will import our dataset. On the application page, click the “browese” button, select your data source, and press “next”. On the following page, you’ll see a bunch of options for customizing your project. We don’t have to change anything, so press “Create Project” on the right.</p>
<p>There is so much you can to with OpenRefine, particularly with <a class="reference external" href="https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/facets">Facets</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/facets#text-filter">Filters</a>, which allow you to edit the spreadsheet by applying changes to patterns across cells rather than individual cells. Let’s say you want to take out some unwanted html elements that appear in your text, or you want to regularize the capitalization or spelling of a certain word or phrase. With facets and filtering, you can easily find the pattern and fix it. See more on this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B70J_H_zAWM&amp;amp;t=73s">tutorial video</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we will do a bit of cleaning.</p>
<section id="cleaning-the-title-column">
<h3>cleaning the “title” column<a class="headerlink" href="#cleaning-the-title-column" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In our case, we are going to work on just one column, the “Title” column. We want to delete the text that comes before the title.</p>
<p>Go to the column that says “Title,” open the dropdown menu, hover over “edit column” and select “split into several columns”</p>
<p><img alt="Split into several columns option" src="../../_images/split.png" /></p>
<p>Then, sure the “by separator” option is selected, which it should be by default. Then, you will choose your “separator,” in the text box below. A separator is the element by which OpenRefine will know where to split the column. For our dataset, we can use the phrase “Session H.R. 1112” to split our columns. That way, we can get just the title in its own column, and get rid of the other (original) column.</p>
<p>Now, we need to generate some regex. For this, I went back to Chat GPT and asked it to generate some regex that finds the pattern. I had to combine these results with what I found on the <a class="reference external" href="https://regex-generator.olafneumann.org/">regex generator</a>, in order to get the code to work.</p>
<p><img alt="chatgpt regex" src="../../_images/chat.png" /></p>
<p>Using that, I generated the string, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Session\s[A-Za-z]\.\s[A-Za-z]\.\s\d{2,4}</span></code>, and input it into the split cells window, making sure to select the regex tickbox.</p>
<p><img alt="splitting cells by regex expression" src="../../_images/split2.png" /></p>
<p>After this, I got rid of the column, renamed the column I did keep to “Title,” and did a “transform” (selecting “common transform”) of trailing whitespace. All of these are under the options “edit column” on the dropdown.</p>
<p>And that’s it! Now my dataset is much cleaner.</p>
<p><img alt="title column cleaned up" src="../../_images/cleaned.png" /></p>
