* python 2: lists to logic
Agenda
- review last week's lessons on Python 1
- review challenge
- lessons for today: lists, loops, logic!
- start working with dicts and CSV module

** review
- data types,
  - what are they?
  - how do we check them?
- we save data by creating variables
- lists
  - list indexing vs slicing
- methods vs functions
  - functions are independant
  - methods depend on objects (also called properties, attributes)
  - can tell in syntax


** lists
- list methods
  - what are they?
  - append, remove, pop, sort
- individual challenge:
  - lookup how to use ~insert()~ method
  - how is this different from other methods we've tried?
- compare with Python docs. Notice the way that documentation   tends to
  be written

** TODO loops
How we do things to data.
- types of data for categorizing data; variables for saving data; how
  to work with lists of data; now, how to do things to
  lists/groupings.
- syntax: for item in collection: print(item).
  - practice with both lists and strings
- a note on variable names:
  - the variable following "for" is assigned on the fly

Challenge:
- write a loop that counts the number of words in a paragraph.
  - You'll need to set up a "counter" variable, to keep track of the
    numbers. Set the initial value of "counter" to 0. 
** logic
** dicts and csv module
- what is a dict?
  - data structure
  - syntax for accessing items
- csv module
  - what is a module? a collection of code for doing something, in
    this case, for opening csv files
  - individual activity: read a little of the docs on CSV module
    - read about, reader, writer, DictReader
    - practice copy/pasting the code into your notebook, but change
      some of the varaibles to customize.

      csv.reader(f)
