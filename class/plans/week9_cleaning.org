* cleaning
Agenda
- mini lesson on cleaning with Python, and on authentication
- talk about final projects, talk through some samples
- time to research areas that you're interested in
- pitch general area that you're interested in working with
- come to class next week with some data to workshop

Mini lesson on cleaning
- get our text
- decode it
- inspect our text for things we want to remove
  - take a slice of the first 1000 chars.
- looping through text to replace it.
  - create a list of things we want to remove
  - loop through that list
  - check if it's in the text
  - if so, replace it
- put all of this in a function!
  - calling and defining the function
  - def add
  - add() takes params
- group challenge: move all the cleaning into a function, then call
  the function on our text.
- save our text with statement

Authentication
- genius API, NYT API, there are different ways to do it.


BREAK

Looking at existing final projects 
- going through a couple of them, reading the code
- try to guess what the code is doing

Freewrite
- what kind of data are you interested in working with or learning
  about?
- where can you find that data?
  - Make a list of at least 2-3 websites.
  - Do the websites have APIs? How accessible are the APIs?
- if you got that data, what could you do with it? Be speculative.
