* data analysis with pandas I

** concepts 

- loading a dataset into a dataframe.
  - df -> basic data structure in pandas
- viewing:
  - df.info() -> data types
  - df.head(), df.tail() 
  - df.shape, df. columns
  - df['column'] -> selecting by column
  - df['column'].values -> array of column values
  - df.describe() -> stats
  - df[0:3] -> slicing rows
- sorting:
  - df.value_counts('column') -> counts highest values per column
  - df.sort_values('column') -> sorts column, try with year
    in descending order
- filtering:
  - df['column'] == 'text string'
    - new_df = (df['column'] == 'text string')
    - df[new_df] -> returns new dataframe with condition
  - other operators: >, <. |, &
  - string methods
    - new_df = df['colum'].str.contains('string text')
    - df.loc[new_df, 'column']

** workshop on datasets
- create a dataframe, soup, or string of text with your data.
- spend some time exploring your dataset in Python.
- use dataframe methods, bs4 methods, or string looping methods to
  extract elements.
- this is a time for exploration with help in the room
- while you're working, think about:
  - what is the data that you want to extract from this dataset?
  - what would you do with that data?

** challenge: do something to your data for next week
