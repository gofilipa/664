# introduction to github

Github is a website that runs on `git`, a version control software
(more on this in the next lesson, on Git). 

For our purposes, we will be learning how to use the website
`github.com`, which is a space for publishing projects, especially
projects that have to do with software.

People use github for [[https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf][a variety of reasons]], like:
- Developing software
- Sharing data sets
- Creating websites
- Writing articles and books
- Keeping research notes
- Hosting syllabi and course materials

## Step 1: Make your very own GitHub account

Create an account by going to github.com.

## Step 2: Create a repository

The first thing we'll do is create a repository. You can think of a
repository as a folder that contains related items, such as files,
images, videos, or even other folders. A repository usually groups
together items that belong to the same "project" or thing you're
working on.

To create a new repository on GitHub:
- Click the  icon next to your username, top-right.
- Name your repository hello-world.
- Write a short description.
- Select Initialize this repository with a README.

## Step 3: Complete your README

This file serves as a title page and abstract for your project. It
also includes information about how you completed the project. Here
are a list of the requirements:

- project title
- project description: explains what the project does
- rationale statement: expresses the motivations behind the project
- workflow: identifies libraries used and explains the important steps
  being taken in the code.
- further uses: in what ways might someone build on this work or
  re-use your code.
- files list: a list of files relevant to the project (python
  notebooks, csv files, etc) and a brief description of what each file
  contains

The readme is generally written in `[[https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/][Mardown]]`, but it can also be
written in plain text `.txt`. 

## Step 4: commit changes

When you are finished editing the file, you can save your changes by
"committing" them. When you commit, you are also required to write a
little commit message. You can say something like "drafting title and
description," whatever you like. Commit messages are useful for
knowing the specific version of your project at this stage.
