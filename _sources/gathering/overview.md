# chapter overview
## learning objectives
This chapter explores approaches for programmatically extracting information from websites using web scraping and APIs. Participants will practice gathering data from the web about news, art, and politics (from the New York Times, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Congress). They will work primarily with the `requests`, `bs4`, and `pandas` libraries and learn principles from object-oriented programming to gather and parse HTML and JSON type data. 

This workshop introduces:
- the differences between web scraping and APIs and what methods are appropriate for specific use cases
- ethical and legal considerations for data gathering, use, and publication
- tools for working with HTML and web browsers generally 
- code libraries for data gathering and simple analysis, like `bs4`, `requests`, and `pandas` 
- object-oriented programming syntax for parsing text based data

These lessons will not to make you an expert at web scraping or APIs, but it will create a solid foundation for you begin gathering data from the web, even if you are a total beginner.
