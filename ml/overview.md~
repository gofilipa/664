# workshop overview

## learning objectives

Welcome to the final workshop in this series, Generating Text! This
workshop builds on the previous ones to fine-tune a text generation
model with Python. Participants will explore Machine Learning (ML)
processes, datasets, and tools, with the goal of customizing a text
generator. They will work primarily with the HuggingFaceðŸ¤— platform
and the `transformers` library in python. At the end of the workshop,
students will take a peak into the process of fine-tuning a model on
the Princeton High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters.

This workshop introduces:
- ML concepts like word vectors and prediction
- the HuggingFaceðŸ¤— platform for models and datasets in ML
