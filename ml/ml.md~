# machine learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a broad topic in Artificial Intelligence (AI)
that contains process in natural language (NLP), computer vision,
speech recognition, and more. In this workshop, we are going to focus
on ML methods for NLP, specifically for text generation. 

Before moving to text generation, however, it's useful to get a sense
of how this process works under the hood. 

## Word Vectors

How does a text generation tool like ChatGPT work? How does it know
what to respond when someone asks it a question? More specifically,
how does it know what language to generate, what words follow other
words?

The answer is that it learns by prediction. It processes massive
amounts of text, and from that processing, it gleans a sense of what
words tend to follow other words.

This is all possible thanks to "word vectors," which is language in a
quantified form. 

Technically speaking, word vectors are representations of words in
graphical space. Each word is represented by a series of numbers that
together make up its coordinate on a graph. 

Practically, each of those numbers consists of a list of
probabilities, which represent it's relationship to another word in
the database.

A vector for the words "cat" and "dog", must look like the following:

| word | tiger | cute | bones | wolf  |
|---+---+---+---+---|
| cat | .90 | .99 | .40 | .35 |
| dog | .35 | .99 | .85 | .90 |
