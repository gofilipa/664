b"Congressional Bills 117th CongressFrom the U.S. Government Publishing OfficeH.R. 1112 Introduced in House (IH)&lt;DOC&gt;117th CONGRESS1st SessionH. R. 1112 To require a report on the military coup in Burma, and for otherpurposes.IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 18, 2021Mr. Connolly (for himself, Mr. Price of North Carolina, and Mr. Buchanan) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs A BILLTo require a report on the military coup in Burma, and for otherpurposes.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Democracy in Burma Act of 2021''.SEC. 2. FINDINGS.Congress finds the following:(1) On March 14, 2005, the House of Representatives agreed to H. Res. 135, which established the House Democracy Assistance Commission (later changed to the House Democracy Partnership, hereafter referred to as ``HDP'') to work directly with parliaments around the world to support the development of effective, independent, and responsive legislative institutions.(2) HDP approved a legislative strengthening partnership with Burma in 2016 and organized the first congressional delegation to meet with the new civilian-led government, led by State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, and civil society leaders in May 2016.(3) On February 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of State assessed that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's ruling party, and President Win Myint, the duly elected head of government, were deposed in a military coup on February 1, 2021.(4) As part of the military coup, the Burmese military declared martial law, suspended the civilian-led government, and detained newly elected Members of Parliament in the capitol, Naypyidaw, thereby usurping the role of the democratically elected government and parliament.SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.It is the sense of Congress that--(1) due to the Burmese military's seizure of government through the detention of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and other government leaders, Burma is not represented by a democratically elected government;(2) the inability of newly elected Members of Parliament to begin their official mandate due to the Burmese military's actions directly threatens the democratic trajectory of Burma's Parliament, and thereby the country;(3) the will and determination of those duly-elected Members of Parliament who are taking it upon themselves to continue serving as representatives of the people through alternative methods of communicating and convening should be lauded; and(4) by preventing the Parliament from completing its work, the Burmese military has rendered impossible and effectively nullified the international collaborative relationships that have supported and strengthened the institution, including the Burmese parliament's partnership with HDP.SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.It is the policy of the United States to--(1) engage with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN member states to--(A) condemn the military coup in Burma;(B) urge the unconditional release of detained democratically elected leaders and civil society members; and(C) support a return to Burma's democratic transition; and(2) instruct, as appropriate, representatives of the United States Government to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to hold accountable those responsible for the military coup in Burma.SEC. 5. REPORT.Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a report on the military coup in Burma, including a description of efforts to implement the policy specified in section 4. &lt;all&gt;</pre></body></html>"b"Congressional Bills 117th CongressFrom the U.S. Government Publishing OfficeH.R. 435 Introduced in House (IH)&lt;DOC&gt;117th CONGRESS1st SessionH.

R. 886 To provide funds through the Social Services Block Grant program fordiaper assistance.IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESFebruary 5, 2021Ms. Lee of California (for herself, Mr. Rush, Mr. Carson, Ms. Meng, Mr. Sires, and Mrs. Hayes) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means A BILLTo provide funds through the Social Services Block Grant program fordiaper assistance.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 Diaper Assistance Act''.SEC. 2. FINDINGS.Congress finds the following:(1) Infants need between 6 to 12 diapers a day. Infants and toddlers lacking access to clean diapers have a greater risk for health complications, which require costly and difficult to access medical care.(2) Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, surveys indicated that 1 in 3 families in the United States with young children could not afford an adequate supply of diapers to keep their child clean, dry, and healthy.(3) Low-income families pay an even higher than average price for diapers because they do not have access to money saving alternatives such as bulk buying or online shopping that can reduce costs. Low-income families spend about 14 percent of their income on diapers.(4) Clean diaper access presents a financial and stressful burden on families' dependent on child care services. Research indicates that when diaper need is a barrier to child care, parents miss an average of 4 workdays a month.(5) The COVID-19 pandemic has further raised demand for diapers and strained diaper banks' ability to meet low-income families' needs. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, nonprofit diaper bank distribution only met 5 to 6 percent of diaper need. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, diaper banks around the country have experienced double, triple, or greater increase in demand for diapers due to the pandemic and economic shutdown. Nonprofits alone cannot fully address this public health crisis that impacts 1 in 3 families in the United States.SEC. 3.
