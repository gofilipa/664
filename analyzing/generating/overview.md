# workshop overview

## learning objectives

Welcome to the final workshop in this series, Generating Text! This
workshop builds on the previous ones to fine-tune a text generation
model with Python. Participants will explore Machine Learning (ML)
processes, datasets, and tools, with the goal of customizing a text
generator. They will work primarily with the HuggingFace🤗 platform
and the `transformers` library in python. At the end of the workshop,
students will take a peak into the process of fine-tuning a model on
the Princeton High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters.

This workshop introduces:
- ML concepts like word vectors and prediction with `word2vec`
- the HuggingFace🤗 platform for models and datasets in ML
- running inference, loading datasets, and fine-tuning ML models with
  Python
- the `transformers` library in Python
- high performance cluster computing at Princeton

## anti-trans legislation

The past couple of years have seen an explosion in anti-trans legislation that restricts basic rights and recognition for trans people. In 2023, more than 500 bills were proposed that prevent trans people from using bathrooms, playing in sports, accessing healthcare, and more in ways that accord with their gender identity. Of those 500 proposals across state legislatures, 87 passed. Compare that number with last year, 2022, 174 bills were proposed, and 26 passed. See the Trans Legislation Tracker for more information.

This workshsop uses Python to scrape basic metadata about the 83 bills that have passed in 2023. This dataset, which is relatively small in size, will be a starting point for a larger dataset to be used in our next workshop on Text Analysis. For that workshop, participants will use Python to gather, clean, and analyze the full text of the bills themselves from congress.gov. They will explore how the terms “gender” and “sex” are being defined across the legislation, among other questions about the language contained within them.

## Python environments

There are many ways to use Python. For this workshop, we will be using
[Jupyter-Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), installed through the
[Python Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)
distrubtion. This option is convenient because it creates a "local"
version of Python directly on your computer, which means you can use
it in mutiple ways and without an internet connection.

For those of you who cannot download Python, you can use [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), a browser-based tool for
running Python code. Like Google Docs, Google Colab creates a
collaborative environment hosted on the Google cloud for authoring
content. Whereas most Python environments require installations (some
of which can be really complicated), Google Colab offers Python
software pre-installed on the cloud environment. It enables new users
to jump right into programming.
