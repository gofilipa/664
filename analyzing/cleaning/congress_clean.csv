     SEC. 1859. PROHIBITION ON FUNDING RESEARCH IN CHINA.

       The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans 
     Affairs, the Secretary of Energy,

[[Page H3505]]

     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
     Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Transportation, 
     the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or any other 
     Federal agency may not directly or indirectly conduct or 
     support, through grants, subgrants, contracts, cooperative 
     agreements or other funding vehicles, research that will be 
     conducted by--
       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China or any 
     agent or instrumentality of the Government of the People's 
     Republic of China or any entity owned by or controlled by the 
     People's Republic of China; or
       (2) the Chinese Communist Party or any agent or 
     instrumentality of the Chinese Communist Party or any entity 
     owned by or controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. Luna) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.
  Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Chairman, to protect American interest, safety, and 
intellectual property, this amendment will end the corrupt practice of 
sending taxpayer dollars to the Chinese Communist Party.
  Our hard-earned money is going to Chinese research, infrastructure, 
and education, and these are the only destinations that we currently 
know about. American dollars are lost with no recuperation or 
retaliation.
  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues across the aisle to support this 
commonsense amendment and support Mr. Williams' legislation.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.
  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Greene of Georgia). The gentlewoman from 
California is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Chair, I oppose this broad reactionary and irresponsible 
amendment because it would harm U.S. interests and undermine scientific 
progress for the American people and the world.
  There is no question that the PRC poses real challenges to the United 
States and that it is engaged in technological and economic competition 
with us. We know that the PRC is engaged in harmful research to boost 
its military, that it engages in technology and IP theft. These are 
challenges worth tackling, and the Biden administration and Congress 
have taken steps to protect ourselves against these activities in 
effective and responsible ways.
  This amendment, however, goes entirely too far. When a careful and 
scalpel-like approach is needed to ensure we are not contributing to 
China's military or providing China with advanced and sensitive 
technology and know-how, this amendment uses a guillotine to cut off 
support for any form of research collaboration between the United 
States and China.
  As drafted, this amendment would prevent any U.S. funding of, 
contracting with, or partnership with any individual or entity 
connected to the PRC government. Let's be clear about what that would 
mean. This would prohibit collaboration with all the major public 
universities in China, endangering academic collaboration and research 
partnerships between U.S. and Chinese institutions.
  We should be worried about AI and supercomputing. This amendment 
would cut off collaboration on completely harmless and often very 
beneficial social science research on things such as poverty reduction 
and economic development.
  This amendment would make it harder for American academics and 
researchers to partner with the Chinese people, many of them who may 
not have any love for the CCP and would benefit from talking directly 
to and working with an American and learning about the freedoms and 
values that Americans enjoy.
  More critically, this amendment would cut off collaboration on 
medical research that could literally save lives of Americans and 
people around the world. Let me give you one example. Right now doctors 
and researchers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New 
York are collaborating with the Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group to 
conduct shared clinical trials in hospitals in the United States and 
China to develop modern cancer drugs. We need to make sure this 
research collaboration happens in a safe and secure way, but why would 
we prohibit it? Why would we not want to work together to find a cure 
for cancer?
  Ultimately, we cannot and must not follow the Chinese Communist 
Party's example and close ourselves off to the world and the Chinese 
people. That is what they do. That is not what America does.
  Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LUNA. Madam Chair, Communism, as well as any country that 
embraces that ideology, is a cancer upon this world and sometimes a 
guillotine is the only solution.
  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to support this 
incredible piece of legislation, and if you don't, that is on you.
  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Chair, I think the comments made by my 
colleague were perfectly appropriate. We have to deal with China and a 
whole series of issues, but to say that we should not collaborate with 
them on basic scientific research, that as was bluntly stated, could 
literally help us cure cancer is not something that is in our best 
interest.
  We also have to realize that China is a major factor in the world. We 
would like to get to a more peaceful relationship with them. Cutting 
off all contact doesn't make sense. Even at the height of the Cold War 
when we were aggressively trying to stand up to the Soviet Union, a 
bipartisan group of legislators kept dialogue up between the two 
countries.
  Madam Chair, I agree with my colleague that this amendment goes too 
far and I urge opposition.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I 
have remaining?
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1\1/2\ minutes remaining.

                              {time}  1430

  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the 
gentlewoman from San Diego, California (Ms. Jacobs).
  Ms. JACOBS. Madam Chair, this is another amendment that is 
fearmongering about China when Republicans are continuing to actually 
undermine our national security by restricting and banning abortion.
  Our servicemembers volunteered to serve in our armed services. They 
didn't volunteer to give up their reproductive rights.
  I am thankful that DOD has taken steps to support servicemembers and 
their dependents' reproductive freedom by covering the travel and 
transportation costs for abortion and fertility care in the post-Roe 
era.
  Let's be clear: DOD's travel policy is consistent with the law. We 
shouldn't reverse this progress and take away our servicemembers' 
freedom when they have already sacrificed so much for us.
  In the 1 year since the Supreme Court struck down the constitutional 
right to an abortion, 20 States have restricted or banned abortion. 
This decision has disproportionately burdened our military families, 
who don't often choose where they are stationed. They can't freely take 
off days from work. Many can't afford to travel thousands of miles and 
pay out of pocket to receive the care they need and deserve, all 
because of the current statutory ban on DOD providing abortion 
services, which I strongly oppose.
  That is why DOD's travel policy has been so important. As one of the 
few women of reproductive age in Congress, I know how important access 
to abortion and fertility care is to our health, freedom, economic 
security, and empowerment.
  Taking away these fundamental rights doesn't just hurt these 
individuals. It hurts our military readiness, recruitment and 
retention, and morale, putting our national security in jeopardy.
  With many people having zero access to abortion services where they 
are stationed, our military's ability to adapt to evolving conflicts 
and challenges has been very compromised.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

            Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Jackson of Texas

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the appropriate place in subtitle A of title VII, insert 
     the following:

     SEC. 7__. PROHIBITION ON PAYMENT AND REIMBURSEMENT BY 
                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OF EXPENSES RELATING TO 
                   ABORTION SERVICES.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) consistent with section 1093 of title 10, United States 
     Code, the Department of Defense may not use any funds for 
     abortions except where the life of the mother would be 
     endangered if the fetus were carried to term or in a case in 
     which the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or 
     incest;
       (2) the Secretary of Defense has no legal authority to 
     implement any policies in which funds are to be used for such 
     purpose; and
       (3) the Department of Defense Memorandum titled ``Ensuring 
     Access to Reproductive Health Care'', dated October 20, 2022, 
     is therefore unlawful and must be rescinded.
       (b) Repeal of Memorandum.--
       (1) Repeal.--The Department of Defense memorandum titled 
     ``Ensuring Access to Reproductive Health Care'', dated 
     October 20, 2022, shall have no force or effect.
       (2) Prohibition on availability of funds to carry out 
     memorandum.--No funds may be obligated or expended to carry 
     out the memorandum specified in paragraph (1) or any 
     successor to such memorandum.
       (c) Prohibition.--Section 1093 of title 10, United States 
     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
     subsection:
       ``(c) Prohibition on Payment or Reimbursement of Certain 
     Fees.--(1) The Secretary of Defense may not pay for or 
     reimburse any fees or expenses, including travel expenses, 
     relating to a health-care professional gaining a license in a 
     State if the purpose of gaining such license is to provide 
     abortion services.
       ``(2) In this subsection:
       ``(A) The term `health-care professional' means a member of 
     the armed forces, civilian employee of the Department of 
     Defense, personal services contractor under section 1091 of 
     this title, or other individual who provides health care at a 
     military medical treatment facility.
       ``(B) The term `license' has the meaning given that term in 
     section 1094 of this title.''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Jackson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Chair, on behalf of myself, my fellow Texan Chip Roy, and over 
70 cosponsors, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in strong support of 
my amendment to repeal the Department of Defense's illegal and immoral 
abortion policy.
  In the wake of the Supreme Court's historic Dobbs decision 
overturning Roe v. Wade, the Biden administration immediately set out 
to sidestep the Court's ruling and circumvent the law wherever 
possible.
  The Biden administration has encouraged every Federal agency to 
create rules and adopt policies that not only expand abortion access 
but also leave American taxpayers on the hook to subsidize abortion 
services.
  As evidence of this, in October of last year, the Secretary of 
Defense released a memo titled: ``Ensuring Access to Reproductive 
Health Care.'' This memo outlined the steps taken by the Department in 
order to use taxpayer dollars to provide servicemembers and their 
dependents access to abortions and allows for taxpayer dollars to be 
used so that healthcare providers can obtain the licensing required to 
perform such procedures.
  According to its illegal policy, which is now in place, DOD can and 
will reimburse travel expenses for servicemembers and their dependents 
who travel specifically to obtain an abortion in another State. The 
Department of Defense will also reimburse any associated fees for 
healthcare professionals seeking to be licensed in another State for 
the purpose of performing abortions--all on the taxpayers' dime.
  Last year, immediately after DOD started this unconstitutional and 
illegal process, Congressman Roy and I got to work on addressing this 
issue and developed a bill to right this wrong.
  This illegal Biden-endorsed policy has no place in our military. 
Taxpayer money provided to DOD is intended to provide for our national 
defense and our national security, not to promote and support the Biden 
administration's radical and immoral pro-abortion agenda.
  As mentioned, regardless of your political or personal stance on 
abortion, this policy is in direct violation of Federal law, 
specifically 10 U.S.C. 1093, which restricts funds made available to 
the DOD from being used for abortions.
  No doubt, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will insist 
that taxpayer dollars are not directly funding abortions, thereby 
rendering the current policy legally sound. This is an absolutely 
misleading claim. This taxpayer money is going directly to support 
abortions, and anyone in this Chamber who says differently is blatantly 
lying to the American people.
  Taxpayer funding of travel for abortion is, in fact, taxpayer-funded 
abortion. Abortion is the sole reason for these travel expenses, and 
this is in clear violation of existing law.
  My Democratic colleagues want to blame me, Senator Tuberville, and my 
colleagues like Congressman Roy for jeopardizing readiness. However, it 
is the Biden administration that has sidestepped existing law and given 
the Department permission to take this illegal action.
  This has left us with no choice but to take corrective measures and 
pass additional legislation. The days of the radical left ignoring the 
law and pushing their destructive social agenda in the military are 
done.
  I absolutely will not waver in my defense of the rule of law, 
therefore ensuring that taxpayer money is not used to kill innocent 
babies and, in doing so, also ensuring that our military servicemembers 
can focus on their jobs that they have in front of them and their 
families instead of being used for the political gain of the Biden 
administration.
  This amendment has over 70 cosponsors because we all recognize that 
the DOD is carrying out an illegal policy that is divisive, immoral, 
and does nothing to provide for our national defense or promote our 
national security.
  Madam Chair, I thank my friend, Congressman Chip Roy, for co-leading 
this amendment with me, for being a relentless defender of the law, and 
for being a true warrior in protecting the life of the unborn.
  I also thank the Military Personnel Subcommittee chairman,   Jim 
Banks, for his support of my amendment and his work on readying our 
servicemembers for the real threats that they face.
  Lastly, I thank Chairman Rogers for creating the strongest defense 
bill I have seen here in my time in Congress.
  Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment 
to repeal this outrageous and illegal policy and prevent any similar 
policy in the future.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Chair, I rise today in vehement opposition to the amendment 
proposed by Representative Jackson.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to thank the troops 
and talk about honoring their sacrifice, and that is all, frankly, 
empty words and broken promises if this amendment passes.
  This amendment puts servicewomen and military families' lives at risk 
by denying the basic right to travel for healthcare that is no longer 
available where they are stationed.
  Now that Iowa passed anti-abortion restrictions, 46 percent of 
servicewomen do not have access to abortion care. This would enact a 
dangerous healthcare travel ban.

[[Page H3507]]

  Servicemembers signed up to put their lives on the line for our 
freedoms, our national values, and our constitutional rights. They did 
not sign up to put their lives on the line or their spouses' lives on 
the line because they cannot get access to basic care.

  I was an officer in the Navy. What I learned was that good leaders 
protect their squadron. They don't abandon them in favor of their own 
politics or agenda.
  How am I supposed to recommend to young girls in my district that 
they should attend a service academy like I did when we know this 
amendment would mean that they would be signing away their right to 
basic healthcare?
  This amendment makes our servicewomen pawns in the majority's extreme 
agenda and is a steppingstone to larger bans, restrictions, and 
wholesale disregard for women's healthcare in America.
  Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
Houlahan), my good friend and a tireless champion for servicewomen.
  Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Chair, I thank Representative Sherrill for 
yielding me time.
  Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to this harmful and dangerous 
amendment, a back door to a national ban on abortion.
  I also rise saddened and frustrated that we find ourselves here in 
this legislative body deciding whether or not we trust our women in 
uniform and our military families to make healthcare decisions for 
themselves.
  Let me say loud and clear, as someone who has worn the uniform, who 
had a child as an Active-Duty member, and who has a uterus, unlike many 
who are opining on this subject, I trust women to make the best 
decisions that they are able to for their own health and their 
families' health.
  It is insulting that we have to stand here and ask our colleagues to 
acknowledge our servicemembers' and military family members' bodily 
autonomy.
  I grew up in a military family, moving dozens of times. When I 
graduated and when the time came, I also raised my right hand.
  Today, that same woman stands before you perplexed. Why would any 
woman want to enlist when her fundamental freedoms and those of her 
family are no longer her own?
  The percentage of Active-Duty servicemembers who have no or severely 
restricted access to abortion is now 46 percent. I strongly urge my 
colleagues to oppose this amendment.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I thank Ms. Houlahan for her comments, and 
I strongly associate myself with the gentlewoman's remarks.
  Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin), 
one of our strongest advocates for women's healthcare.
  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Chair, I rise today with my colleagues in 
opposition to this amendment, and I want to make sure that everyone 
understands what this amendment means. This amendment, plus other 
amendments that are the exact same in the Appropriations Committee, 
plus the same hold that is going on by Senator Tuberville, are putting 
culture wars ahead of national security.
  We understand that Mr. Jackson, the author of this amendment, is from 
Texas and that he supports an outright ban on all abortions, including 
for rape and for incest. We understand that he doesn't trust women. He 
certainly can't claim to care about recruitment into the military.
  What we cannot miss, though, is that this is part and parcel of a 
goal from a party that wants a Federal ban on abortion. It wasn't 
enough that we overturned Roe in our Supreme Court, and it doesn't 
matter if States like Michigan vote on their ballot to preserve Roe. 
The majority will not stop until there is a Federal ban where it won't 
matter what happens in States.
  Madam Chair, I stand in strong opposition to this amendment.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I couldn't agree more with the 
gentlewoman, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time 
remains.
  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Tenney). The gentleman has 1 minute remaining.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. Rogers).
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.
  DOD's abortion travel policy is a flagrant violation of the 
congressional intent and our Nation's moral principles. This policy is 
part of the Biden administration's politicization of the military. It 
is completely unnecessary, and it is clearly unlawful.
  Madam Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. Luna).
  Mrs. LUNA. Madam Chair, I want to start out by saying that I am a 
United States Air Force veteran and a woman who has been elected to 
Congress while pregnant who supports this because of the fact that not 
only does it completely attack our ability to be military ready, but 
when you are advocating for a servicemember to have a child ripped from 
their womb, they can't deploy.
  To say that this is constitutional in their argument and to say that 
Republicans are somehow attacking women in service because we support 
this is not only a lie, but it completely just destroys everything that 
this military stands for.
  Not only are there religious objections to taxpayers funding this 
type of stuff, but to say as a military servicemember that you would be 
somehow hurting someone's rights in the military because you stand with 
life is pretty bizarre to me.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Escobar), who is someone who not only fights for women in Congress but 
fights against her home State's draconian laws.
  Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, 
which, make no mistake about it, is the Republican Party's backdoor 
effort to create a national abortion ban.
  I represent El Paso, Texas, which is home to Fort Bliss, one of our 
country's premier military installations. I serve on the House Armed 
Services Committee, and I am a mother of two.

  My colleagues want to ensure that the enlisted women of the United 
States military and their family members who live in Republican States 
where abortion has been banned are forced to carry a pregnancy to term, 
even in the case of rape and incest.
  Unlike my Republican colleagues, I trust women, and unlike my 
Republican colleagues, I believe women have a place in the United 
States military and that it is our job to support them.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from New Jersey has the only time 
remaining.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield the remaining time to the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), who is my friend and a valued 
colleague and partner in this effort.
  Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to this extreme and 
misguided amendment.
  In Iraq and Afghanistan, I fought alongside servicemembers from every 
race, gender, and political affiliation, and we had each other's backs. 
We still do. So, I will not sit quietly while people attack the rights 
of women who have stood up to serve this country. We owe them better 
than this.
  It is extreme, misguided, and inconsistent with the values of our 
Nation and our military.
  Madam Chair, as a standard-bearer of those values, I urge my 
colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair, I rise to express my outrage at 
the far-right minority in this Congress attempting to force their 
extreme anti-abortion agenda onto what should be a bipartisan bill.
  We all know the Dobbs decision last year decimated abortion access, 
including for over half of active-duty female servicemembers. In 
response, the Department of Defense announced important changes to 
safeguard reproductive health care access.
  Amendment No. 5 aims to revoke those protections and push 
reproductive care further out of reach.
  It is a shame that MAGA Republicans can trust women to defend our 
nation on battlefields but refuse to trust them to make their own 
healthcare decisions.
  The military offers vast healthcare and educational benefits to 
service members. Women

[[Page H3508]]

continue to be the fastest growing demographic in the military, but 
restricting their rights tells them they're not welcome.
  If my colleagues care about personal freedom, they will vote NO on 
this amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will 
be postponed.

                              {time}  1445

               Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Rosendale

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       In subtitle A of title VII, add at the end the following:

     SEC. 714. PROHIBITION ON COVERAGE OF CERTAIN SEX REASSIGNMENT 
                   SURGERIES AND RELATED SERVICES UNDER TRICARE 
                   PROGRAM.

       Chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by 
     inserting after section 1076f the following new section (and 
     conforming the table of sections at the beginning of such 
     chapter accordingly):

     ``Sec. 1076g. TRICARE program: prohibition on coverage and 
       furnishment of certain sex reassignment surgeries and 
       related services

       ``(a) Prohibition.--The medical care to which individuals 
     are entitled to under this chapter does not include the 
     services described in subsection (b) and the Secretary of 
     Defense may not furnish any such service.
       ``(b) Services Described.--The services described in this 
     subsection are the following:
       ``(1) Sex reassignment surgeries furnished for the purpose 
     of the gender alteration of a transgender individual.
       ``(2) Hormone treatments furnished for the purpose of the 
     gender alteration of a transgender individual.''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Montana (Mr. Rosendale) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana.
  Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Chair, today I rise in support of my amendment 
No. 10.
  Amendment No. 10 is a very simple amendment. It would prohibit 
TRICARE from covering sex reassignment surgeries and hormone treatment 
for transgender individuals. The most recent numbers tell us that the 
Department of Defense has performed over 240 gender reassignment 
surgeries, costing taxpayers approximately $3.1 million.
  Unfortunately, that is just a small part of the cost associated with 
this transaction. The Department has spent over $11.5 million on 
psychotherapy. That is it; psychotherapy for servicemembers with gender 
dysphoria.
  The amount of funds paid out for this psychotherapy shows that the 
surgery alone cannot solve the root issue for these individuals. This 
does nothing to help our troops continue to be the most effective 
fighting force on Earth and is nothing but a distraction and a waste of 
valuable taxpayer dollars. The government has no business funding these 
procedures on the taxpayer's dime.
  The question that must be asked is whether having trans individuals 
makes the United States a more lethal force and whether it helps 
recruit the best and most effective talent for the United States 
military. The answer to that is a clear and resounding no.
  A report commissioned by General Mattis found that servicemembers

  Ms. MACE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would mandate the Comptroller 
General carry out a study to determine the adverse effects of allowing 
biological men to compete in women's sports. It looks at the adverse 
psychological, developmental participatory, and sociological results to 
girls of allowing males to compete, be members of a sports team, or 
participants in athletic programs that are designed specifically for 
girls, including hostile environment creation, sexual assault, and 
sexual harassment.
  We are going to call this today the Riley Gaines report. Riley Gaines 
lifetime of hard work was undermined by a biological male who was 
wrongly allowed to compete against women in NCAA-sanctioned 
competition.
  Furthermore, she had to deal with the psychological trauma of being 
forced to share a locker room and change in front of a biological man. 
Subjecting more women to this is cruel.
  All of the glass ceilings that have been shattered by women in sports 
have been for naught if we allow this to continue, so I am going to 
stand with women and fight for their fair right to competition.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I claim time to speak in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment perpetuates false arguments 
that allowing transgender girls to participate on school sports teams 
will undermine the well-being of cisgender girls.
  Again, my friends across the aisle are conflating and confusing the 
issue here. They want to talk about the struggles and the challenges we 
have with determining fair competition in elite sports, but what we are 
talking about here is a bill, the underlying bill, which would 
completely ban participation of all transgender kids across our 
country.
  As I said, the example in Utah, 75,000 high school students competing 
in high school sports, four transgender kids, one competing as a 
female. This seems wholly, wholly, disproportionate to the so-called 
problem. What is disproportionate is this proposal to completely ban 
transgender students from sports.
  Now, I want to say something here. The other side does not even want 
to acknowledge that transgender kids exist; that transgender people 
exist.
  Nevertheless, the legislation and this amendment target transgender 
kids, and they do it in a very, very insidious way. They will say, oh, 
transgender doesn't appear in this bill. But let's not kid ourselves 
that the very intent is to harm and stigmatize, isolate, make them 
pariahs, and this is simply wrong.
  Look, I am not a scientist. I was an English teacher most of my time 
before I got into Congress. I do know the harm that comes with this 
insidious use of language, by not even granting the dignity of 
existing, not even granting the dignity of the existence of trans kids 
and trans people. That is what the other side is doing.
  It is going to be harmful. How is it harmful? This mere debate has 
traumatized trans kids and their families across the country. Eighty-
five percent of transgender and nonbinary youth say that the debates 
around anti-trans bills have negatively impacted their mental health.
  According to a 2022 survey, nearly one in five transgender and 
nonbinary youth attempted suicide in the past year, and 45 percent of 
LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year. 
These statistics are real. They represent real vulnerable kids. I urge 
my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to oppose the underlying 
bill.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. MACE. Mr. Chairman, for years, the left has said to follow the 
science. Well, today, Republicans are following the science. We are not 
confused about the differences between biological men and biological 
women.
  As a woman who is pro-LGBTQ, I don't care how you dress. I don't care 
what pronoun you take. I don't care if you change your gender. But we 
ought to protect biological women and girls in their athletics and 
their achievements.
  As someone who has broken glass ceilings, I am the first woman to 
graduate from The Citadel, the Military

[[Page H1892]]

College of South Carolina. We don't want biological men taking away the 
achievements of women who fought so hard for where they are today.
  It was 100 years after women's suffrage that South Carolina elected 
the first ever Republican woman to Congress. That is what I did in 
2020.
  We don't want to take these achievements away from women at all. We 
are not confused. Having biological men in locker rooms, as a mom of a 
girl, and hearing Riley Gaines' story, and as someone who was molested 
at 14, raped at 16, the risks to our girls and to women by biological 
men in some of these cases and the stories that we have heard, we ought 
to do our damnedest to protect women and girls in sports.
  This is not insidious. What is insidious is allowing men in girls' 
locker rooms as they are changing, as they are showering. That is 
perverted; it is insidious; it is disgusting.
  We want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to protect 
women and girls. This report will study that and bring the results to 
Congress.
  I thank Riley Gaines for sharing her story, putting it out there, and 
talking about the realities of what is going on in this country.
  I can tell you the other side is very much confused. They are so 
confused now that Republicans have become the feminists of today.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from South 
Carolina for a colloquy to answer some questions.
  I know the gentlewoman to be open-minded about LGB people, but I 
wonder if she has ever sat down and met with any of her transgender 
constituents.
  Ms. MACE. I have. I actually know transgender constituents. I know 
transgender children. I have friends in my district that have 
transgender kids. I am very well aware.
  Mr. TAKANO. Reclaiming my time. So the gentlewoman does recognize 
that transgender kids and transgender people exist.
  Ms. MACE. Yes, 100 percent.
  Mr. TAKANO. Reclaiming my time. So it is curious to me that the 
gentlewoman has not included even the word ``transgender.'' She uses 
the word ``biological male,'' and the study that she has put forward 
studies the harm done to cisgender girls by having them compete with 
biological males. It does not even provide the guidance to the studiers 
to study what may happen with cisgender girls and the competition with 
transgender girls. So the results of this study are not going to even 
determine what the challenges may be.
  Look, the mere fact that the author of this amendment is asking to 
study this shows that there is no evidence that there is any harm here.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Ms. MACE. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time is remaining.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 2 minutes remaining.
  Ms. MACE. Mr. Chairman, when we use the term ``biological men,'' we 
are actually following the science because for years the left has said 
follow the science. When you are born a biological male, you are born 
with physical advantages over women.
  We do want to study the psychological effect on women in sports, in 
their locker rooms. We want to study what is going on and how it 
negatively impacts women.
  Women should not be ignored in this situation, whether they are in 
the classroom, or on a sports team, or in the private sector.
  As I mentioned before, I know and have met with plenty of transgender 
individuals. This is not against the LGBTQ community. We are pro-women 
today, and that is what this amendment is about, protecting women and 
girls against biological men who want to compete against them.
  I don't think any of us have any discontent if transgender girls 
wanted to have their own sports teams and compete at that level because 
the physical differences between biological men and biological women 
are very different. We want to make sure that we are going to protect 
them, and that we don't have any other women going through what Riley 
Gaines went through. It was wrong then; it is wrong now.
  I am proud of this amendment and the work that we are doing to 
protect women and girls. As I said before, I have broken many glass 
ceilings, and I don't want to see those achievements taken away from 
biological women who have worked so hard to get to where they are 
today.
  We want to set a good example that they can achieve anything they 
want in America, anything they want in the United States of America. If 
they have goals, they work hard to achieve them. They can do anything 
they want, and no man will get in their way.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from South Carolina (Ms. Mace).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Ms. MACE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from South 
Carolina will be postponed.


                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Ogles

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 
printed in House Report 118-37.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 1, line 17, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(4)''.
       Page 1 after line 16, insert the following:
       ``(3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term 
     `athletic programs and activities' includes, but is not 
     limited to, all programs or activities that are provided 
     conditional upon participation with any athletic team.''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 298, the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I am grateful that the House of Representatives is taking a stand to 
protect women and girls in this country and to ensure that they 
continue to have access to athletic opportunities at school. I strongly 
support the Protecting Women and Girls in Sports Act.
  My amendment strengthens the underlying bill by protecting schools 
from a weaponized bureaucracy and frivolous lawsuits as they work to 
comply with the intentions of the bill.
  Many schools provide a wide range of programs and activities to 
support their student athletes. This amendment ensures that schools can 
continue to provide a range of resources exclusively or preferentially 
to members of an athletic team without worrying about activist 
bureaucrats or opportunistic trial lawyers targeting them with 
disingenuous arguments about what constitutes an athletic program or 
activity.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, again, the assertion that the underlying 
bill is about protecting women and girls couldn't be farther from the 
truth. We know that in States that have inclusive policies toward trans 
girls and women in sports, that the overall participation of girls and 
women is greater.
  Those States that have enacted bans on transgender participation have 
seen a decrease in overall participation. Why might that be?
  Well, we know that in Utah, that some parents of cisgender girls who 
have seen their girls lose in competition have questioned whether or 
not the winner is actually a girl because of nonconformance to 
perceived notions of femininity. Authorities in that State have 
actually subjected the winner, the girl who was a winner, to an 
examination of documents dating back to her kindergarten days in order 
for her to prove that she was indeed a female.
  Think about the chilling effect that this has had on other women and 
girls

[[Page H1893]]

from participating in sports. The teenage years are a difficult time 
enough but think about what this ban has imposed.
  Let me tell you, Republicans are not satisfied with just banning 
transgender girls from competition in athletics. What this amendment 
will do is to accomplish full exclusion of transgender people, not only 
from athletic programs, but from any other auxiliary programming that a 
student would want to participate with their teams.
  Not only are they interested in assuring that transgender girls and 
women can't enjoy the benefits of the athletic aspects of team sports, 
but they also want to make sure that trans students who, statistically 
speaking, already face intense marginalization in school environments 
are deprived of the opportunity to make friends, to be included, and 
just have fun.

                              {time}  0930

  No wonder more than half of transgender kids have thought about 
suicide or have attempted it.
  This amendment is the example that represents the whole. The nature 
of this amendment is what is at the heart of this bill. It is not about 
competition. It is about participation.
  I wish that they would stop using examples of difficulties in elite 
competitions as a justification to harm transgender kids all across 
this Nation and exclude them not only from sports but also exclude them 
from sports banquets or special study halls that may be associated with 
athletes.
  This is an insidious amendment. It is an insidious bill. It is 
contrary to our values as Americans.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, no woman or girl in our country should be 
forced to lose competitions to biological men. No school in our country 
should be punished for fighting to preserve the integrity of women's 
sports.
  We cannot pass up an opportunity to protect schools from adverse 
actions accusing them of discrimination when they provide a tutor to a 
team or they let athletes move into a dorm early or accommodate a 
practice schedule.
  We know Democrats will work to pursue every loophole imaginable to 
undermine this bill, and we should take this opportunity to stop them 
before they can start.
  Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I would just say let's allow, at the very 
elite level, organizations like the International Olympic Committee and 
the NCAA to make determinations of what constitutes fairness, not 
impose the Federal Government where it is not necessary. Transgender 
athletes have been welcomed into participation for 20 years now and 
only recently has it become a major issue in our country.
  Mr. Chair, where have the Republicans' concerns about government 
overreach gone? Where have the concerns about allowing States and 
voluntary associations to solve problems before the Federal Government 
is brought to bear gone?
  Certainly, we should not be using one or two examples at the elite 
sports level to affect the participation of transgender girls and women 
all across our country in high schools and colleges.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, I reiterate that no woman or girl should be 
forced to lose competitions to biological men. I say that as a father 
of a daughter who is an athlete. I say that as a father to two sons who 
are athletes. Girls should play girls' sports, and boys should play 
boys' sports.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I would say that organizations like the NCAA 
and the International Olympic Committee can resolve these issues about 
fairness in competition, but we should not neglect the greater value of 
participation, connecting to others in society and welcoming everybody 
into the community. This bill and this amendment do not do that, and 
they put our transgender kids in harm's way.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles).
  The amendment was agreed to.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.
  The motion was agreed to.
  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
Edwards) having assumed the chair, Mr. Flood, Acting Chair of the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that 
that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 734) to 
amend the Education Amendments of 1972 to provide that for purposes of 
determining compliance with title IX of such Act in athletics, sex 
shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and 
genetics at birth, had come to no resolution thereon.

achievements of women who fought so hard for where they are today.
  It was 100 years after women's suffrage that South Carolina elected 
the first ever Republican woman to Congress. That is what I did in 
2020.
  We don't want to take these achievements away from women at all. We 
are not confused. Having biological men in locker rooms, as a mom of a 
girl, and hearing Riley Gaines' story, and as someone who was molested 
at 14, raped at 16, the risks to our girls and to women by biological 
men in some of these cases and the stories that we have heard, we ought 
to do our damnedest to protect women and girls in sports.
  This is not insidious. What is insidious is allowing men in girls' 
locker rooms as they are changing, as they are showering. That is 
perverted; it is insidious; it is disgusting.
  We want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to protect 
women and girls. This report will study that and bring the results to 
Congress.
  I thank Riley Gaines for sharing her story, putting it out there, and 
talking about the realities of what is going on in this country.
  I can tell you the other side is very much confused. They are so 
confused now that Republicans have become the feminists of today.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from South 
Carolina for a colloquy to answer some questions.
  I know the gentlewoman to be open-minded about LGB people, but I 
wonder if she has ever sat down and met with any of her transgender 
constituents.
  Ms. MACE. I have. I actually know transgender constituents. I know 
transgender children. I have friends in my district that have 
transgender kids. I am very well aware.
  Mr. TAKANO. Reclaiming my time. So the gentlewoman does recognize 
that transgender kids and transgender people exist.
  Ms. MACE. Yes, 100 percent.
  Mr. TAKANO. Reclaiming my time. So it is curious to me that the 
gentlewoman has not included even the word ``transgender.'' She uses 
the word ``biological male,'' and the study that she has put forward 
studies the harm done to cisgender girls by having them compete with 
biological males. It does not even provide the guidance to the studiers 
to study what may happen with cisgender girls and the competition with 
transgender girls. So the results of this study are not going to even 
determine what the challenges may be.
  Look, the mere fact that the author of this amendment is asking to 
study this shows that there is no evidence that there is any harm here.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Ms. MACE. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time is remaining.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 2 minutes remaining.
  Ms. MACE. Mr. Chairman, when we use the term ``biological men,'' we 
are actually following the science because for years the left has said 
follow the science. When you are born a biological male, you are born 
with physical advantages over women.
  We do want to study the psychological effect on women in sports, in 
their locker rooms. We want to study what is going on and how it 
negatively impacts women.
  Women should not be ignored in this situation, whether they are in 
the classroom, or on a sports team, or in the private sector.
  As I mentioned before, I know and have met with plenty of transgender 
individuals. This is not against the LGBTQ community. We are pro-women 
today, and that is what this amendment is about, protecting women and 
girls against biological men who want to compete against them.
  I don't think any of us have any discontent if transgender girls 
wanted to have their own sports teams and compete at that level because 
the physical differences between biological men and biological women 
are very different. We want to make sure that we are going to protect 
them, and that we don't have any other women going through what Riley 
Gaines went through. It was wrong then; it is wrong now.
  I am proud of this amendment and the work that we are doing to 
protect women and girls. As I said before, I have broken many glass 
ceilings, and I don't want to see those achievements taken away from 
biological women who have worked so hard to get to where they are 
today.
  We want to set a good example that they can achieve anything they 
want in America, anything they want in the United States of America. If 
they have goals, they work hard to achieve them. They can do anything 
they want, and no man will get in their way.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from South Carolina (Ms. Mace).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Ms. MACE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from South 
Carolina will be postponed.


                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Ogles

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 
printed in House Report 118-37.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 1, line 17, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(4)''.
       Page 1 after line 16, insert the following:
       ``(3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term 
     `athletic programs and activities' includes, but is not 
     limited to, all programs or activities that are provided 
     conditional upon participation with any athletic team.''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 298, the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I am grateful that the House of Representatives is taking a stand to 
protect women and girls in this country and to ensure that they 
continue to have access to athletic opportunities at school. I strongly 
support the Protecting Women and Girls in Sports Act.
  My amendment strengthens the underlying bill by protecting schools 
from a weaponized bureaucracy and frivolous lawsuits as they work to 
comply with the intentions of the bill.
  Many schools provide a wide range of programs and activities to 
support their student athletes. This amendment ensures that schools can 
continue to provide a range of resources exclusively or preferentially 
to members of an athletic team without worrying about activist 
bureaucrats or opportunistic trial lawyers targeting them with 
disingenuous arguments about what constitutes an athletic program or 
activity.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, again, the assertion that the underlying 
bill is about protecting women and girls couldn't be farther from the 
truth. We know that in States that have inclusive policies toward trans 
girls and women in sports, that the overall participation of girls and 
women is greater.
  Those States that have enacted bans on transgender participation have 
seen a decrease in overall participation. Why might that be?
  Well, we know that in Utah, that some parents of cisgender girls who 
have seen their girls lose in competition have questioned whether or 
not the winner is actually a girl because of nonconformance to 
perceived notions of femininity. Authorities in that State have 
actually subjected the winner, the girl who was a winner, to an 
examination of documents dating back to her kindergarten days in order 
for her to prove that she was indeed a female.
  Think about the chilling effect that this has had on other women and 
girls

[[Page H1893]]

from participating in sports. The teenage years are a difficult time 
enough but think about what this ban has imposed.
  Let me tell you, Republicans are not satisfied with just banning 
transgender girls from competition in athletics. What this amendment 
will do is to accomplish full exclusion of transgender people, not only 
from athletic programs, but from any other auxiliary programming that a 
student would want to participate with their teams.
  Not only are they interested in assuring that transgender girls and 
women can't enjoy the benefits of the athletic aspects of team sports, 
but they also want to make sure that trans students who, statistically 
speaking, already face intense marginalization in school environments 
are deprived of the opportunity to make friends, to be included, and 
just have fun.

                              {time}  0930

  No wonder more than half of transgender kids have thought about 
suicide or have attempted it.
  This amendment is the example that represents the whole. The nature 
of this amendment is what is at the heart of this bill. It is not about 
competition. It is about participation.
  I wish that they would stop using examples of difficulties in elite 
competitions as a justification to harm transgender kids all across 
this Nation and exclude them not only from sports but also exclude them 
from sports banquets or special study halls that may be associated with 
athletes.
  This is an insidious amendment. It is an insidious bill. It is 
contrary to our values as Americans.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, no woman or girl in our country should be 
forced to lose competitions to biological men. No school in our country 
should be punished for fighting to preserve the integrity of women's 
sports.
  We cannot pass up an opportunity to protect schools from adverse 
actions accusing them of discrimination when they provide a tutor to a 
team or they let athletes move into a dorm early or accommodate a 
practice schedule.
  We know Democrats will work to pursue every loophole imaginable to 
undermine this bill, and we should take this opportunity to stop them 
before they can start.
  Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I would just say let's allow, at the very 
elite level, organizations like the International Olympic Committee and 
the NCAA to make determinations of what constitutes fairness, not 
impose the Federal Government where it is not necessary. Transgender 
athletes have been welcomed into participation for 20 years now and 
only recently has it become a major issue in our country.
  Mr. Chair, where have the Republicans' concerns about government 
overreach gone? Where have the concerns about allowing States and 
voluntary associations to solve problems before the Federal Government 
is brought to bear gone?
  Certainly, we should not be using one or two examples at the elite 
sports level to affect the participation of transgender girls and women 
all across our country in high schools and colleges.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, I reiterate that no woman or girl should be 
forced to lose competitions to biological men. I say that as a father 
of a daughter who is an athlete. I say that as a father to two sons who 
are athletes. Girls should play girls' sports, and boys should play 
boys' sports.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I would say that organizations like the NCAA 
and the International Olympic Committee can resolve these issues about 
fairness in competition, but we should not neglect the greater value of 
participation, connecting to others in society and welcoming everybody 
into the community. This bill and this amendment do not do that, and 
they put our transgender kids in harm's way.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles).
  The amendment was agreed to.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.
  The motion was agreed to.
  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
Edwards) having assumed the chair, Mr. Flood, Acting Chair of the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that 
that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 734) to 
amend the Education Amendments of 1972 to provide that for purposes of 
determining compliance with title IX of such Act in athletics, sex 
shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and 
genetics at birth, had come to no resolution thereon.

                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Luna

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer amendment No. 1 as the designee 
of Mr. Williams of New York.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end of subtitle C of title XVIII the following:

     SEC. 1859. PROHIBITION ON FUNDING RESEARCH IN CHINA.

       The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans 
     Affairs, the Secretary of Energy,

[[Page H3505]]

     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
     Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Transportation, 
     the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or any other 
     Federal agency may not directly or indirectly conduct or 
     support, through grants, subgrants, contracts, cooperative 
     agreements or other funding vehicles, research that will be 
     conducted by--
       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China or any 
     agent or instrumentality of the Government of the People's 
     Republic of China or any entity owned by or controlled by the 
     People's Republic of China; or
       (2) the Chinese Communist Party or any agent or 
     instrumentality of the Chinese Communist Party or any entity 
     owned by or controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. Luna) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.
  Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Chairman, to protect American interest, safety, and 
intellectual property, this amendment will end the corrupt practice of 
sending taxpayer dollars to the Chinese Communist Party.
  Our hard-earned money is going to Chinese research, infrastructure, 
and education, and these are the only destinations that we currently 
know about. American dollars are lost with no recuperation or 
retaliation.
  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues across the aisle to support this 
commonsense amendment and support Mr. Williams' legislation.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.
  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Greene of Georgia). The gentlewoman from 
California is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Chair, I oppose this broad reactionary and irresponsible 
amendment because it would harm U.S. interests and undermine scientific 
progress for the American people and the world.
  There is no question that the PRC poses real challenges to the United 
States and that it is engaged in technological and economic competition 
with us. We know that the PRC is engaged in harmful research to boost 
its military, that it engages in technology and IP theft. These are 
challenges worth tackling, and the Biden administration and Congress 
have taken steps to protect ourselves against these activities in 
effective and responsible ways.
  This amendment, however, goes entirely too far. When a careful and 
scalpel-like approach is needed to ensure we are not contributing to 
China's military or providing China with advanced and sensitive 
technology and know-how, this amendment uses a guillotine to cut off 
support for any form of research collaboration between the United 
States and China.
  As drafted, this amendment would prevent any U.S. funding of, 
contracting with, or partnership with any individual or entity 
connected to the PRC government. Let's be clear about what that would 
mean. This would prohibit collaboration with all the major public 
universities in China, endangering academic collaboration and research 
partnerships between U.S. and Chinese institutions.
  We should be worried about AI and supercomputing. This amendment 
would cut off collaboration on completely harmless and often very 
beneficial social science research on things such as poverty reduction 
and economic development.
  This amendment would make it harder for American academics and 
researchers to partner with the Chinese people, many of them who may 
not have any love for the CCP and would benefit from talking directly 
to and working with an American and learning about the freedoms and 
values that Americans enjoy.
  More critically, this amendment would cut off collaboration on 
medical research that could literally save lives of Americans and 
people around the world. Let me give you one example. Right now doctors 
and researchers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New 
York are collaborating with the Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group to 
conduct shared clinical trials in hospitals in the United States and 
China to develop modern cancer drugs. We need to make sure this 
research collaboration happens in a safe and secure way, but why would 
we prohibit it? Why would we not want to work together to find a cure 
for cancer?
  Ultimately, we cannot and must not follow the Chinese Communist 
Party's example and close ourselves off to the world and the Chinese 
people. That is what they do. That is not what America does.
  Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LUNA. Madam Chair, Communism, as well as any country that 
embraces that ideology, is a cancer upon this world and sometimes a 
guillotine is the only solution.
  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to support this 
incredible piece of legislation, and if you don't, that is on you.
  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Chair, I think the comments made by my 
colleague were perfectly appropriate. We have to deal with China and a 
whole series of issues, but to say that we should not collaborate with 
them on basic scientific research, that as was bluntly stated, could 
literally help us cure cancer is not something that is in our best 
interest.
  We also have to realize that China is a major factor in the world. We 
would like to get to a more peaceful relationship with them. Cutting 
off all contact doesn't make sense. Even at the height of the Cold War 
when we were aggressively trying to stand up to the Soviet Union, a 
bipartisan group of legislators kept dialogue up between the two 
countries.
  Madam Chair, I agree with my colleague that this amendment goes too 
far and I urge opposition.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I 
have remaining?
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1\1/2\ minutes remaining.

                              {time}  1430

  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the 
gentlewoman from San Diego, California (Ms. Jacobs).
  Ms. JACOBS. Madam Chair, this is another amendment that is 
fearmongering about China when Republicans are continuing to actually 
undermine our national security by restricting and banning abortion.
  Our servicemembers volunteered to serve in our armed services. They 
didn't volunteer to give up their reproductive rights.
  I am thankful that DOD has taken steps to support servicemembers and 
their dependents' reproductive freedom by covering the travel and 
transportation costs for abortion and fertility care in the post-Roe 
era.
  Let's be clear: DOD's travel policy is consistent with the law. We 
shouldn't reverse this progress and take away our servicemembers' 
freedom when they have already sacrificed so much for us.
  In the 1 year since the Supreme Court struck down the constitutional 
right to an abortion, 20 States have restricted or banned abortion. 
This decision has disproportionately burdened our military families, 
who don't often choose where they are stationed. They can't freely take 
off days from work. Many can't afford to travel thousands of miles and 
pay out of pocket to receive the care they need and deserve, all 
because of the current statutory ban on DOD providing abortion 
services, which I strongly oppose.
  That is why DOD's travel policy has been so important. As one of the 
few women of reproductive age in Congress, I know how important access 
to abortion and fertility care is to our health, freedom, economic 
security, and empowerment.
  Taking away these fundamental rights doesn't just hurt these 
individuals. It hurts our military readiness, recruitment and 
retention, and morale, putting our national security in jeopardy.
  With many people having zero access to abortion services where they 
are stationed, our military's ability to adapt to evolving conflicts 
and challenges has been very compromised.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Luna).
  The amendment was agreed to.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 2 will not 
be offered.
  The Chair understands that amendment No. 3 will not be offered.
  The Chair understands that amendment No. 4 will not be offered.


            Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Jackson of Texas

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the appropriate place in subtitle A of title VII, insert 
     the following:

     SEC. 7__. PROHIBITION ON PAYMENT AND REIMBURSEMENT BY 
                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OF EXPENSES RELATING TO 
                   ABORTION SERVICES.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) consistent with section 1093 of title 10, United States 
     Code, the Department of Defense may not use any funds for 
     abortions except where the life of the mother would be 
     endangered if the fetus were carried to term or in a case in 
     which the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or 
     incest;
       (2) the Secretary of Defense has no legal authority to 
     implement any policies in which funds are to be used for such 
     purpose; and
       (3) the Department of Defense Memorandum titled ``Ensuring 
     Access to Reproductive Health Care'', dated October 20, 2022, 
     is therefore unlawful and must be rescinded.
       (b) Repeal of Memorandum.--
       (1) Repeal.--The Department of Defense memorandum titled 
     ``Ensuring Access to Reproductive Health Care'', dated 
     October 20, 2022, shall have no force or effect.
       (2) Prohibition on availability of funds to carry out 
     memorandum.--No funds may be obligated or expended to carry 
     out the memorandum specified in paragraph (1) or any 
     successor to such memorandum.
       (c) Prohibition.--Section 1093 of title 10, United States 
     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
     subsection:
       ``(c) Prohibition on Payment or Reimbursement of Certain 
     Fees.--(1) The Secretary of Defense may not pay for or 
     reimburse any fees or expenses, including travel expenses, 
     relating to a health-care professional gaining a license in a 
     State if the purpose of gaining such license is to provide 
     abortion services.
       ``(2) In this subsection:
       ``(A) The term `health-care professional' means a member of 
     the armed forces, civilian employee of the Department of 
     Defense, personal services contractor under section 1091 of 
     this title, or other individual who provides health care at a 
     military medical treatment facility.
       ``(B) The term `license' has the meaning given that term in 
     section 1094 of this title.''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Jackson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Chair, on behalf of myself, my fellow Texan Chip Roy, and over 
70 cosponsors, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in strong support of 
my amendment to repeal the Department of Defense's illegal and immoral 
abortion policy.
  In the wake of the Supreme Court's historic Dobbs decision 
overturning Roe v. Wade, the Biden administration immediately set out 
to sidestep the Court's ruling and circumvent the law wherever 
possible.
  The Biden administration has encouraged every Federal agency to 
create rules and adopt policies that not only expand abortion access 
but also leave American taxpayers on the hook to subsidize abortion 
services.
  As evidence of this, in October of last year, the Secretary of 
Defense released a memo titled: ``Ensuring Access to Reproductive 
Health Care.'' This memo outlined the steps taken by the Department in 
order to use taxpayer dollars to provide servicemembers and their 
dependents access to abortions and allows for taxpayer dollars to be 
used so that healthcare providers can obtain the licensing required to 
perform such procedures.
  According to its illegal policy, which is now in place, DOD can and 
will reimburse travel expenses for servicemembers and their dependents 
who travel specifically to obtain an abortion in another State. The 
Department of Defense will also reimburse any associated fees for 
healthcare professionals seeking to be licensed in another State for 
the purpose of performing abortions--all on the taxpayers' dime.
  Last year, immediately after DOD started this unconstitutional and 
illegal process, Congressman Roy and I got to work on addressing this 
issue and developed a bill to right this wrong.
  This illegal Biden-endorsed policy has no place in our military. 
Taxpayer money provided to DOD is intended to provide for our national 
defense and our national security, not to promote and support the Biden 
administration's radical and immoral pro-abortion agenda.
  As mentioned, regardless of your political or personal stance on 
abortion, this policy is in direct violation of Federal law, 
specifically 10 U.S.C. 1093, which restricts funds made available to 
the DOD from being used for abortions.
  No doubt, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will insist 
that taxpayer dollars are not directly funding abortions, thereby 
rendering the current policy legally sound. This is an absolutely 
misleading claim. This taxpayer money is going directly to support 
abortions, and anyone in this Chamber who says differently is blatantly 
lying to the American people.
  Taxpayer funding of travel for abortion is, in fact, taxpayer-funded 
abortion. Abortion is the sole reason for these travel expenses, and 
this is in clear violation of existing law.
  My Democratic colleagues want to blame me, Senator Tuberville, and my 
colleagues like Congressman Roy for jeopardizing readiness. However, it 
is the Biden administration that has sidestepped existing law and given 
the Department permission to take this illegal action.
  This has left us with no choice but to take corrective measures and 
pass additional legislation. The days of the radical left ignoring the 
law and pushing their destructive social agenda in the military are 
done.
  I absolutely will not waver in my defense of the rule of law, 
therefore ensuring that taxpayer money is not used to kill innocent 
babies and, in doing so, also ensuring that our military servicemembers 
can focus on their jobs that they have in front of them and their 
families instead of being used for the political gain of the Biden 
administration.
  This amendment has over 70 cosponsors because we all recognize that 
the DOD is carrying out an illegal policy that is divisive, immoral, 
and does nothing to provide for our national defense or promote our 
national security.
  Madam Chair, I thank my friend, Congressman Chip Roy, for co-leading 
this amendment with me, for being a relentless defender of the law, and 
for being a true warrior in protecting the life of the unborn.
  I also thank the Military Personnel Subcommittee chairman,   Jim 
Banks, for his support of my amendment and his work on readying our 
servicemembers for the real threats that they face.
  Lastly, I thank Chairman Rogers for creating the strongest defense 
bill I have seen here in my time in Congress.
  Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment 
to repeal this outrageous and illegal policy and prevent any similar 
policy in the future.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Chair, I rise today in vehement opposition to the amendment 
proposed by Representative Jackson.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to thank the troops 
and talk about honoring their sacrifice, and that is all, frankly, 
empty words and broken promises if this amendment passes.
  This amendment puts servicewomen and military families' lives at risk 
by denying the basic right to travel for healthcare that is no longer 
available where they are stationed.
  Now that Iowa passed anti-abortion restrictions, 46 percent of 
servicewomen do not have access to abortion care. This would enact a 
dangerous healthcare travel ban.

[[Page H3507]]

  Servicemembers signed up to put their lives on the line for our 
freedoms, our national values, and our constitutional rights. They did 
not sign up to put their lives on the line or their spouses' lives on 
the line because they cannot get access to basic care.

  I was an officer in the Navy. What I learned was that good leaders 
protect their squadron. They don't abandon them in favor of their own 
politics or agenda.
  How am I supposed to recommend to young girls in my district that 
they should attend a service academy like I did when we know this 
amendment would mean that they would be signing away their right to 
basic healthcare?
  This amendment makes our servicewomen pawns in the majority's extreme 
agenda and is a steppingstone to larger bans, restrictions, and 
wholesale disregard for women's healthcare in America.
  Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
Houlahan), my good friend and a tireless champion for servicewomen.
  Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Chair, I thank Representative Sherrill for 
yielding me time.
  Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to this harmful and dangerous 
amendment, a back door to a national ban on abortion.
  I also rise saddened and frustrated that we find ourselves here in 
this legislative body deciding whether or not we trust our women in 
uniform and our military families to make healthcare decisions for 
themselves.
  Let me say loud and clear, as someone who has worn the uniform, who 
had a child as an Active-Duty member, and who has a uterus, unlike many 
who are opining on this subject, I trust women to make the best 
decisions that they are able to for their own health and their 
families' health.
  It is insulting that we have to stand here and ask our colleagues to 
acknowledge our servicemembers' and military family members' bodily 
autonomy.
  I grew up in a military family, moving dozens of times. When I 
graduated and when the time came, I also raised my right hand.
  Today, that same woman stands before you perplexed. Why would any 
woman want to enlist when her fundamental freedoms and those of her 
family are no longer her own?
  The percentage of Active-Duty servicemembers who have no or severely 
restricted access to abortion is now 46 percent. I strongly urge my 
colleagues to oppose this amendment.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I thank Ms. Houlahan for her comments, and 
I strongly associate myself with the gentlewoman's remarks.
  Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin), 
one of our strongest advocates for women's healthcare.
  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Chair, I rise today with my colleagues in 
opposition to this amendment, and I want to make sure that everyone 
understands what this amendment means. This amendment, plus other 
amendments that are the exact same in the Appropriations Committee, 
plus the same hold that is going on by Senator Tuberville, are putting 
culture wars ahead of national security.
  We understand that Mr. Jackson, the author of this amendment, is from 
Texas and that he supports an outright ban on all abortions, including 
for rape and for incest. We understand that he doesn't trust women. He 
certainly can't claim to care about recruitment into the military.
  What we cannot miss, though, is that this is part and parcel of a 
goal from a party that wants a Federal ban on abortion. It wasn't 
enough that we overturned Roe in our Supreme Court, and it doesn't 
matter if States like Michigan vote on their ballot to preserve Roe. 
The majority will not stop until there is a Federal ban where it won't 
matter what happens in States.
  Madam Chair, I stand in strong opposition to this amendment.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I couldn't agree more with the 
gentlewoman, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time 
remains.
  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Tenney). The gentleman has 1 minute remaining.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. Rogers).
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.
  DOD's abortion travel policy is a flagrant violation of the 
congressional intent and our Nation's moral principles. This policy is 
part of the Biden administration's politicization of the military. It 
is completely unnecessary, and it is clearly unlawful.
  Madam Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. Luna).
  Mrs. LUNA. Madam Chair, I want to start out by saying that I am a 
United States Air Force veteran and a woman who has been elected to 
Congress while pregnant who supports this because of the fact that not 
only does it completely attack our ability to be military ready, but 
when you are advocating for a servicemember to have a child ripped from 
their womb, they can't deploy.
  To say that this is constitutional in their argument and to say that 
Republicans are somehow attacking women in service because we support 
this is not only a lie, but it completely just destroys everything that 
this military stands for.
  Not only are there religious objections to taxpayers funding this 
type of stuff, but to say as a military servicemember that you would be 
somehow hurting someone's rights in the military because you stand with 
life is pretty bizarre to me.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Escobar), who is someone who not only fights for women in Congress but 
fights against her home State's draconian laws.
  Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, 
which, make no mistake about it, is the Republican Party's backdoor 
effort to create a national abortion ban.
  I represent El Paso, Texas, which is home to Fort Bliss, one of our 
country's premier military installations. I serve on the House Armed 
Services Committee, and I am a mother of two.

  My colleagues want to ensure that the enlisted women of the United 
States military and their family members who live in Republican States 
where abortion has been banned are forced to carry a pregnancy to term, 
even in the case of rape and incest.
  Unlike my Republican colleagues, I trust women, and unlike my 
Republican colleagues, I believe women have a place in the United 
States military and that it is our job to support them.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from New Jersey has the only time 
remaining.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield the remaining time to the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), who is my friend and a valued 
colleague and partner in this effort.
  Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to this extreme and 
misguided amendment.
  In Iraq and Afghanistan, I fought alongside servicemembers from every 
race, gender, and political affiliation, and we had each other's backs. 
We still do. So, I will not sit quietly while people attack the rights 
of women who have stood up to serve this country. We owe them better 
than this.
  It is extreme, misguided, and inconsistent with the values of our 
Nation and our military.
  Madam Chair, as a standard-bearer of those values, I urge my 
colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair, I rise to express my outrage at 
the far-right minority in this Congress attempting to force their 
extreme anti-abortion agenda onto what should be a bipartisan bill.
  We all know the Dobbs decision last year decimated abortion access, 
including for over half of active-duty female servicemembers. In 
response, the Department of Defense announced important changes to 
safeguard reproductive health care access.
  Amendment No. 5 aims to revoke those protections and push 
reproductive care further out of reach.
  It is a shame that MAGA Republicans can trust women to defend our 
nation on battlefields but refuse to trust them to make their own 
healthcare decisions.
  The military offers vast healthcare and educational benefits to 
service members. Women

continue to be the fastest growing demographic in the military, but 
restricting their rights tells them they're not welcome.
  If my colleagues care about personal freedom, they will vote NO on 
this amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will 
be postponed.

               Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Rosendale

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       In subtitle A of title VII, add at the end the following:

     SEC. 714. PROHIBITION ON COVERAGE OF CERTAIN SEX REASSIGNMENT 
                   SURGERIES AND RELATED SERVICES UNDER TRICARE 
                   PROGRAM.

       Chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by 
     inserting after section 1076f the following new section (and 
     conforming the table of sections at the beginning of such 
     chapter accordingly):

     ``Sec. 1076g. TRICARE program: prohibition on coverage and 
       furnishment of certain sex reassignment surgeries and 
       related services

       ``(a) Prohibition.--The medical care to which individuals 
     are entitled to under this chapter does not include the 
     services described in subsection (b) and the Secretary of 
     Defense may not furnish any such service.
       ``(b) Services Described.--The services described in this 
     subsection are the following:
       ``(1) Sex reassignment surgeries furnished for the purpose 
     of the gender alteration of a transgender individual.
       ``(2) Hormone treatments furnished for the purpose of the 
     gender alteration of a transgender individual.''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Montana (Mr. Rosendale) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana.
  Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Chair, today I rise in support of my amendment 
No. 10.
  Amendment No. 10 is a very simple amendment. It would prohibit 
TRICARE from covering sex reassignment surgeries and hormone treatment 
for transgender individuals. The most recent numbers tell us that the 
Department of Defense has performed over 240 gender reassignment 
surgeries, costing taxpayers approximately $3.1 million.
  Unfortunately, that is just a small part of the cost associated with 
this transaction. The Department has spent over $11.5 million on 
psychotherapy. That is it; psychotherapy for servicemembers with gender 
dysphoria.
  The amount of funds paid out for this psychotherapy shows that the 
surgery alone cannot solve the root issue for these individuals. This 
does nothing to help our troops continue to be the most effective 
fighting force on Earth and is nothing but a distraction and a waste of 
valuable taxpayer dollars. The government has no business funding these 
procedures on the taxpayer's dime.
  The question that must be asked is whether having trans individuals 
makes the United States a more lethal force and whether it helps 
recruit the best and most effective talent for the United States 
military. The answer to that is a clear and resounding no.

XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 2670.
  Will the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost) kindly resume the chair.

                              {time}  1420


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 2670) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2024 
for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military 
construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, 
to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for 
other purposes, with Mr. Bost (Acting Chair) in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today

printed in House Report 118-141 offered by the gentleman from Alabama 
(Mr. Rogers) has been disposed of.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 583, no further amendment to the bill, 
as amended, shall be in order except those printed in House Report 118-
142 and amendments en bloc described in section 3 of House Resolution 
583.
  Each further amendment printed in the report shall be considered only 
in the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member 
designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be 
debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and 
controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to 
amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the 
question.
  It shall be in order at that time for the chair of the Committee on 
Armed Services or his designee to offer the amendments en bloc 
consisting of amendments printed in the report not earlier disposed of. 
Amendments en bloc shall be considered as read, shall be debated for 30 
minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking

                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Luna

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer amendment No. 1 as the designee 
of Mr. Williams of New York.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end of subtitle C of title XVIII the following:

     SEC. 1859. PROHIBITION ON FUNDING RESEARCH IN CHINA.

       The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans 
     Affairs, the Secretary of Energy,

[[Page H3505]]

     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
     Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Transportation, 
     the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or any other 
     Federal agency may not directly or indirectly conduct or 
     support, through grants, subgrants, contracts, cooperative 
     agreements or other funding vehicles, research that will be 
     conducted by--
       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China or any 
     agent or instrumentality of the Government of the People's 
     Republic of China or any entity owned by or controlled by the 
     People's Republic of China; or
       (2) the Chinese Communist Party or any agent or 
     instrumentality of the Chinese Communist Party or any entity 
     owned by or controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. Luna) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.
  Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Chairman, to protect American interest, safety, and 
intellectual property, this amendment will end the corrupt practice of 
sending taxpayer dollars to the Chinese Communist Party.
  Our hard-earned money is going to Chinese research, infrastructure, 
and education, and these are the only destinations that we currently 
know about. American dollars are lost with no recuperation or 
retaliation.
  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues across the aisle to support this 
commonsense amendment and support Mr. Williams' legislation.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.
  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Greene of Georgia). The gentlewoman from 
California is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Chair, I oppose this broad reactionary and irresponsible 
amendment because it would harm U.S. interests and undermine scientific 
progress for the American people and the world.
  There is no question that the PRC poses real challenges to the United 
States and that it is engaged in technological and economic competition 
with us. We know that the PRC is engaged in harmful research to boost 
its military, that it engages in technology and IP theft. These are 
challenges worth tackling, and the Biden administration and Congress 
have taken steps to protect ourselves against these activities in 
effective and responsible ways.
  This amendment, however, goes entirely too far. When a careful and 
scalpel-like approach is needed to ensure we are not contributing to 
China's military or providing China with advanced and sensitive 
technology and know-how, this amendment uses a guillotine to cut off 
support for any form of research collaboration between the United 
States and China.
  As drafted, this amendment would prevent any U.S. funding of, 
contracting with, or partnership with any individual or entity 
connected to the PRC government. Let's be clear about what that would 
mean. This would prohibit collaboration with all the major public 
universities in China, endangering academic collaboration and research 
partnerships between U.S. and Chinese institutions.
  We should be worried about AI and supercomputing. This amendment 
would cut off collaboration on completely harmless and often very 
beneficial social science research on things such as poverty reduction 
and economic development.
  This amendment would make it harder for American academics and 
researchers to partner with the Chinese people, many of them who may 
not have any love for the CCP and would benefit from talking directly 
to and working with an American and learning about the freedoms and 
values that Americans enjoy.
  More critically, this amendment would cut off collaboration on 
medical research that could literally save lives of Americans and 
people around the world. Let me give you one example. Right now doctors 
and researchers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New 
York are collaborating with the Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group to 
conduct shared clinical trials in hospitals in the United States and 
China to develop modern cancer drugs. We need to make sure this 
research collaboration happens in a safe and secure way, but why would 
we prohibit it? Why would we not want to work together to find a cure 
for cancer?
  Ultimately, we cannot and must not follow the Chinese Communist 
Party's example and close ourselves off to the world and the Chinese 
people. That is what they do. That is not what America does.
  Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LUNA. Madam Chair, Communism, as well as any country that 
embraces that ideology, is a cancer upon this world and sometimes a 
guillotine is the only solution.
  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to support this 
incredible piece of legislation, and if you don't, that is on you.
  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Chair, I think the comments made by my 
colleague were perfectly appropriate. We have to deal with China and a 
whole series of issues, but to say that we should not collaborate with 
them on basic scientific research, that as was bluntly stated, could 
literally help us cure cancer is not something that is in our best 
interest.
  We also have to realize that China is a major factor in the world. We 
would like to get to a more peaceful relationship with them. Cutting 
off all contact doesn't make sense. Even at the height of the Cold War 
when we were aggressively trying to stand up to the Soviet Union, a 
bipartisan group of legislators kept dialogue up between the two 
countries.
  Madam Chair, I agree with my colleague that this amendment goes too 
far and I urge opposition.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I 
have remaining?
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1\1/2\ minutes remaining.

                              {time}  1430

  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the 
gentlewoman from San Diego, California (Ms. Jacobs).
  Ms. JACOBS. Madam Chair, this is another amendment that is 
fearmongering about China when Republicans are continuing to actually 
undermine our national security by restricting and banning abortion.
  Our servicemembers volunteered to serve in our armed services. They 
didn't volunteer to give up their reproductive rights.
  I am thankful that DOD has taken steps to support servicemembers and 
their dependents' reproductive freedom by covering the travel and 
transportation costs for abortion and fertility care in the post-Roe 
era.
  Let's be clear: DOD's travel policy is consistent with the law. We 
shouldn't reverse this progress and take away our servicemembers' 
freedom when they have already sacrificed so much for us.
  In the 1 year since the Supreme Court struck down the constitutional 
right to an abortion, 20 States have restricted or banned abortion. 
This decision has disproportionately burdened our military families, 
who don't often choose where they are stationed. They can't freely take 
off days from work. Many can't afford to travel thousands of miles and 
pay out of pocket to receive the care they need and deserve, all 
because of the current statutory ban on DOD providing abortion 
services, which I strongly oppose.
  That is why DOD's travel policy has been so important. As one of the 
few women of reproductive age in Congress, I know how important access 
to abortion and fertility care is to our health, freedom, economic 
security, and empowerment.
  Taking away these fundamental rights doesn't just hurt these 
individuals. It hurts our military readiness, recruitment and 
retention, and morale, putting our national security in jeopardy.
  With many people having zero access to abortion services where they 
are stationed, our military's ability to adapt to evolving conflicts 
and challenges has been very compromised.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Luna).
  The amendment was agreed to.

            Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Jackson of Texas

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the appropriate place in subtitle A of title VII, insert 
     the following:

     SEC. 7__. PROHIBITION ON PAYMENT AND REIMBURSEMENT BY 
                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OF EXPENSES RELATING TO 
                   ABORTION SERVICES.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) consistent with section 1093 of title 10, United States 
     Code, the Department of Defense may not use any funds for 
     abortions except where the life of the mother would be 
     endangered if the fetus were carried to term or in a case in 
     which the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or 
     incest;
       (2) the Secretary of Defense has no legal authority to 
     implement any policies in which funds are to be used for such 
     purpose; and
       (3) the Department of Defense Memorandum titled ``Ensuring 
     Access to Reproductive Health Care'', dated October 20, 2022, 
     is therefore unlawful and must be rescinded.
       (b) Repeal of Memorandum.--
       (1) Repeal.--The Department of Defense memorandum titled 
     ``Ensuring Access to Reproductive Health Care'', dated 
     October 20, 2022, shall have no force or effect.
       (2) Prohibition on availability of funds to carry out 
     memorandum.--No funds may be obligated or expended to carry 
     out the memorandum specified in paragraph (1) or any 
     successor to such memorandum.
       (c) Prohibition.--Section 1093 of title 10, United States 
     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
     subsection:
       ``(c) Prohibition on Payment or Reimbursement of Certain 
     Fees.--(1) The Secretary of Defense may not pay for or 
     reimburse any fees or expenses, including travel expenses, 
     relating to a health-care professional gaining a license in a 
     State if the purpose of gaining such license is to provide 
     abortion services.
       ``(2) In this subsection:
       ``(A) The term `health-care professional' means a member of 
     the armed forces, civilian employee of the Department of 
     Defense, personal services contractor under section 1091 of 
     this title, or other individual who provides health care at a

       ``(B) The term `license' has the meaning given that term in 
     section 1094 of this title.''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Jackson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Chair, on behalf of myself, my fellow Texan Chip Roy, and over 
70 cosponsors, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in strong support of 
my amendment to repeal the Department of Defense's illegal and immoral 
abortion policy.
  In the wake of the Supreme Court's historic Dobbs decision 
overturning Roe v. Wade, the Biden administration immediately set out 
to sidestep the Court's ruling and circumvent the law wherever 
possible.
  The Biden administration has encouraged every Federal agency to 
create rules and adopt policies that not only expand abortion access 
but also leave American taxpayers on the hook to subsidize abortion 
services.
  As evidence of this, in October of last year, the Secretary of 
Defense released a memo titled: ``Ensuring Access to Reproductive 
Health Care.'' This memo outlined the steps taken by the Department in 
order to use taxpayer dollars to provide servicemembers and their 
dependents access to abortions and allows for taxpayer dollars to be 
used so that healthcare providers can obtain the licensing required to 
perform such procedures.
  According to its illegal policy, which is now in place, DOD can and 
will reimburse travel expenses for servicemembers and their dependents 
who travel specifically to obtain an abortion in another State. The 
Department of Defense will also reimburse any associated fees for 
healthcare professionals seeking to be licensed in another State for 
the purpose of performing abortions--all on the taxpayers' dime.
  Last year, immediately after DOD started this unconstitutional and 
illegal process, Congressman Roy and I got to work on addressing this 
issue and developed a bill to right this wrong.
  This illegal Biden-endorsed policy has no place in our military. 
Taxpayer money provided to DOD is intended to provide for our national 
defense and our national security, not to promote and support the Biden 
administration's radical and immoral pro-abortion agenda.
  As mentioned, regardless of your political or personal stance on 
abortion, this policy is in direct violation of Federal law, 
specifically 10 U.S.C. 1093, which restricts funds made available to 
the DOD from being used for abortions.
  No doubt, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will insist 
that taxpayer dollars are not directly funding abortions, thereby 
rendering the current policy legally sound. This is an absolutely 
misleading claim. This taxpayer money is going directly to support 
abortions, and anyone in this Chamber who says differently is blatantly 
lying to the American people.
  Taxpayer funding of travel for abortion is, in fact, taxpayer-funded 
abortion. Abortion is the sole reason for these travel expenses, and 
this is in clear violation of existing law.
  My Democratic colleagues want to blame me, Senator Tuberville, and my 
colleagues like Congressman Roy for jeopardizing readiness. However, it 
is the Biden administration that has sidestepped existing law and given 
the Department permission to take this illegal action.
  This has left us with no choice but to take corrective measures and 
pass additional legislation. The days of the radical left ignoring the 
law and pushing their destructive social agenda in the military are 
done.
  I absolutely will not waver in my defense of the rule of law, 
therefore ensuring that taxpayer money is not used to kill innocent 
babies and, in doing so, also ensuring that our military servicemembers 
can focus on their jobs that they have in front of them and their 
families instead of being used for the political gain of the Biden 
administration.
  This amendment has over 70 cosponsors because we all recognize that 
the DOD is carrying out an illegal policy that is divisive, immoral, 
and does nothing to provide for our national defense or promote our 
national security.
  Madam Chair, I thank my friend, Congressman Chip Roy, for co-leading 
this amendment with me, for being a relentless defender of the law, and 
for being a true warrior in protecting the life of the unborn.
  I also thank the Military Personnel Subcommittee chairman,   Jim 
Banks, for his support of my amendment and his work on readying our 
servicemembers for the real threats that they face.
  Lastly, I thank Chairman Rogers for creating the strongest defense 
bill I have seen here in my time in Congress.
  Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment 
to repeal this outrageous and illegal policy and prevent any similar 
policy in the future.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Chair, I rise today in vehement opposition to the amendment 
proposed by Representative Jackson.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to thank the troops 
and talk about honoring their sacrifice, and that is all, frankly, 
empty words and broken promises if this amendment passes.
  This amendment puts servicewomen and military families' lives at risk 
by denying the basic right to travel for healthcare that is no longer 
available where they are stationed.
  Now that Iowa passed anti-abortion restrictions, 46 percent of 
servicewomen do not have access to abortion care. This would enact a 
dangerous healthcare travel ban.

[[Page H3507]]

  Servicemembers signed up to put their lives on the line for our 
freedoms, our national values, and our constitutional rights. They did 
not sign up to put their lives on the line or their spouses' lives on 
the line because they cannot get access to basic care.

  I was an officer in the Navy. What I learned was that good leaders 
protect their squadron. They don't abandon them in favor of their own 
politics or agenda.
  How am I supposed to recommend to young girls in my district that 
they should attend a service academy like I did when we know this 
amendment would mean that they would be signing away their right to 
basic healthcare?
  This amendment makes our servicewomen pawns in the majority's extreme 
agenda and is a steppingstone to larger bans, restrictions, and 
wholesale disregard for women's healthcare in America.
  Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
Houlahan), my good friend and a tireless champion for servicewomen.
  Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Chair, I thank Representative Sherrill for 
yielding me time.
  Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to this harmful and dangerous 
amendment, a back door to a national ban on abortion.
  I also rise saddened and frustrated that we find ourselves here in 
this legislative body deciding whether or not we trust our women in 
uniform and our military families to make healthcare decisions for 
themselves.
  Let me say loud and clear, as someone who has worn the uniform, who 
had a child as an Active-Duty member, and who has a uterus, unlike many 
who are opining on this subject, I trust women to make the best 
decisions that they are able to for their own health and their 
families' health.
  It is insulting that we have to stand here and ask our colleagues to 
acknowledge our servicemembers' and military family members' bodily 
autonomy.
  I grew up in a military family, moving dozens of times. When I 
graduated and when the time came, I also raised my right hand.
  Today, that same woman stands before you perplexed. Why would any 
woman want to enlist when her fundamental freedoms and those of her 
family are no longer her own?
  The percentage of Active-Duty servicemembers who have no or severely 
restricted access to abortion is now 46 percent. I strongly urge my 
colleagues to oppose this amendment.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I thank Ms. Houlahan for her comments, and 
I strongly associate myself with the gentlewoman's remarks.
  Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin), 
one of our strongest advocates for women's healthcare.
  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Chair, I rise today with my colleagues in 
opposition to this amendment, and I want to make sure that everyone 
understands what this amendment means. This amendment, plus other 
amendments that are the exact same in the Appropriations Committee, 
plus the same hold that is going on by Senator Tuberville, are putting 
culture wars ahead of national security.
  We understand that Mr. Jackson, the author of this amendment, is from 
Texas and that he supports an outright ban on all abortions, including 
for rape and for incest. We understand that he doesn't trust women. He 
certainly can't claim to care about recruitment into the military.
  What we cannot miss, though, is that this is part and parcel of a 
goal from a party that wants a Federal ban on abortion. It wasn't 
enough that we overturned Roe in our Supreme Court, and it doesn't 
matter if States like Michigan vote on their ballot to preserve Roe. 
The majority will not stop until there is a Federal ban where it won't 
matter what happens in States.
  Madam Chair, I stand in strong opposition to this amendment.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I couldn't agree more with the 
gentlewoman, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time 
remains.
  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Tenney). The gentleman has 1 minute remaining.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. Rogers).
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.
  DOD's abortion travel policy is a flagrant violation of the 
congressional intent and our Nation's moral principles. This policy is 
part of the Biden administration's politicization of the military. It 
is completely unnecessary, and it is clearly unlawful.
  Madam Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. Luna).
  Mrs. LUNA. Madam Chair, I want to start out by saying that I am a 
United States Air Force veteran and a woman who has been elected to 
Congress while pregnant who supports this because of the fact that not 
only does it completely attack our ability to be military ready, but 
when you are advocating for a servicemember to have a child ripped from 
their womb, they can't deploy.
  To say that this is constitutional in their argument and to say that 
Republicans are somehow attacking women in service because we support 
this is not only a lie, but it completely just destroys everything that 
this military stands for.
  Not only are there religious objections to taxpayers funding this 
type of stuff, but to say as a military servicemember that you would be 
somehow hurting someone's rights in the military because you stand with 
life is pretty bizarre to me.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Escobar), who is someone who not only fights for women in Congress but 
fights against her home State's draconian laws.
  Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, 
which, make no mistake about it, is the Republican Party's backdoor 
effort to create a national abortion ban.
  I represent El Paso, Texas, which is home to Fort Bliss, one of our 
country's premier military installations. I serve on the House Armed 
Services Committee, and I am a mother of two.

  My colleagues want to ensure that the enlisted women of the United 
States military and their family members who live in Republican States 
where abortion has been banned are forced to carry a pregnancy to term, 
even in the case of rape and incest.
  Unlike my Republican colleagues, I trust women, and unlike my 
Republican colleagues, I believe women have a place in the United 
States military and that it is our job to support them.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from New Jersey has the only time 
remaining.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield the remaining time to the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), who is my friend and a valued 
colleague and partner in this effort.
  Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to this extreme and 
misguided amendment.
  In Iraq and Afghanistan, I fought alongside servicemembers from every 
race, gender, and political affiliation, and we had each other's backs. 
We still do. So, I will not sit quietly while people attack the rights 
of women who have stood up to serve this country. We owe them better 
than this.
  It is extreme, misguided, and inconsistent with the values of our 
Nation and our military.
  Madam Chair, as a standard-bearer of those values, I urge my 
colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair, I rise to express my outrage at 
the far-right minority in this Congress attempting to force their 
extreme anti-abortion agenda onto what should be a bipartisan bill.
  We all know the Dobbs decision last year decimated abortion access, 
including for over half of active-duty female servicemembers. In 
response, the Department of Defense announced important changes to 
safeguard reproductive health care access.
  Amendment No. 5 aims to revoke those protections and push 
reproductive care further out of reach.
  It is a shame that MAGA Republicans can trust women to defend our 
nation on battlefields but refuse to trust them to make their own 
healthcare decisions.
  The military offers vast healthcare and educational benefits to 
service members. Women

continue to be the fastest growing demographic in the military, but 
restricting their rights tells them they're not welcome.
  If my colleagues care about personal freedom, they will vote NO on 
this amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will 
be postponed.

               Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Rosendale

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       In subtitle A of title VII, add at the end the following:

     SEC. 714. PROHIBITION ON COVERAGE OF CERTAIN SEX REASSIGNMENT 
                   SURGERIES AND RELATED SERVICES UNDER TRICARE 
                   PROGRAM.

       Chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by 
     inserting after section 1076f the following new section (and 
     conforming the table of sections at the beginning of such 
     chapter accordingly):

     ``Sec. 1076g. TRICARE program: prohibition on coverage and 
       furnishment of certain sex reassignment surgeries and 
       related services

       ``(a) Prohibition.--The medical care to which individuals 
     are entitled to under this chapter does not include the 
     services described in subsection (b) and the Secretary of 
     Defense may not furnish any such service.
       ``(b) Services Described.--The services described in this 
     subsection are the following:
       ``(1) Sex reassignment surgeries furnished for the purpose 
     of the gender alteration of a transgender individual.
       ``(2) Hormone treatments furnished for the purpose of the 
     gender alteration of a transgender individual.''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Montana (Mr. Rosendale) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana.
  Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Chair, today I rise in support of my amendment 
No. 10.
  Amendment No. 10 is a very simple amendment. It would prohibit 
TRICARE from covering sex reassignment surgeries and hormone treatment 
for transgender individuals. The most recent numbers tell us that the 
Department of Defense has performed over 240 gender reassignment 
surgeries, costing taxpayers approximately $3.1 million.
  Unfortunately, that is just a small part of the cost associated with 
this transaction. The Department has spent over $11.5 million on 
psychotherapy. That is it; psychotherapy for servicemembers with gender 
dysphoria.
  The amount of funds paid out for this psychotherapy shows that the 
surgery alone cannot solve the root issue for these individuals. This 
does nothing to help our troops continue to be the most effective 
fighting force on Earth and is nothing but a distraction and a waste of 
valuable taxpayer dollars. The government has no business funding these 
procedures on the taxpayer's dime.
  The question that must be asked is whether having trans individuals 
makes the United States a more lethal force and whether it helps 
recruit the best and most effective talent for the United States 
military. The answer to that is a clear and resounding no.

  Will the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost) kindly resume the chair.

                              {time}  1420


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 2670) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2024 
for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military 
construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy,

printed in House Report 118-141 offered by the gentleman from Alabama 
(Mr. Rogers) has been disposed of.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 583, no further amendment to the bill, 
as amended, shall be in order except those printed in House Report 118-
142 and amendments en bloc described in section 3 of House Resolution 
583.
  Each further amendment printed in the report shall be considered only 
in the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member 
designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be 
debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and 
controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to 
amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the 
question.
  It shall be in order at that time for the chair of the Committee on 
Armed Services or his designee to offer the amendments en bloc 
consisting of amendments printed in the report not earlier disposed of. 
Amendments en bloc shall be considered as read, shall be debated for 30 
minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking

                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Luna

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer amendment No. 1 as the designee 
of Mr. Williams of New York.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end of subtitle C of title XVIII the following:

     SEC. 1859. PROHIBITION ON FUNDING RESEARCH IN CHINA.

       The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Veterans 
     Affairs, the Secretary of Energy,

[[Page H3505]]

     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
     Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Transportation, 
     the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or any other 
     Federal agency may not directly or indirectly conduct or 
     support, through grants, subgrants, contracts, cooperative 
     agreements or other funding vehicles, research that will be 
     conducted by--
       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China or any 
     agent or instrumentality of the Government of the People's 
     Republic of China or any entity owned by or controlled by the 
     People's Republic of China; or
       (2) the Chinese Communist Party or any agent or 
     instrumentality of the Chinese Communist Party or any entity 
     owned by or controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. Luna) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.
  Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Chairman, to protect American interest, safety, and 
intellectual property, this amendment will end the corrupt practice of 
sending taxpayer dollars to the Chinese Communist Party.
  Our hard-earned money is going to Chinese research, infrastructure, 
and education, and these are the only destinations that we currently 
know about. American dollars are lost with no recuperation or 
retaliation.
  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues across the aisle to support this 
commonsense amendment and support Mr. Williams' legislation.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.
  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Greene of Georgia). The gentlewoman from 
California is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Chair, I oppose this broad reactionary and irresponsible 
amendment because it would harm U.S. interests and undermine scientific 
progress for the American people and the world.
  There is no question that the PRC poses real challenges to the United 
States and that it is engaged in technological and economic competition 
with us. We know that the PRC is engaged in harmful research to boost 
its military, that it engages in technology and IP theft. These are 
challenges worth tackling, and the Biden administration and Congress 
have taken steps to protect ourselves against these activities in 
effective and responsible ways.
  This amendment, however, goes entirely too far. When a careful and 
scalpel-like approach is needed to ensure we are not contributing to 
China's military or providing China with advanced and sensitive 
technology and know-how, this amendment uses a guillotine to cut off 
support for any form of research collaboration between the United 
States and China.
  As drafted, this amendment would prevent any U.S. funding of, 
contracting with, or partnership with any individual or entity 
connected to the PRC government. Let's be clear about what that would 
mean. This would prohibit collaboration with all the major public 
universities in China, endangering academic collaboration and research 
partnerships between U.S. and Chinese institutions.
  We should be worried about AI and supercomputing. This amendment 
would cut off collaboration on completely harmless and often very 
beneficial social science research on things such as poverty reduction 
and economic development.
  This amendment would make it harder for American academics and 
researchers to partner with the Chinese people, many of them who may 
not have any love for the CCP and would benefit from talking directly 
to and working with an American and learning about the freedoms and 
values that Americans enjoy.
  More critically, this amendment would cut off collaboration on 
medical research that could literally save lives of Americans and 
people around the world. Let me give you one example. Right now doctors 
and researchers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New 
York are collaborating with the Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group to 
conduct shared clinical trials in hospitals in the United States and 
China to develop modern cancer drugs. We need to make sure this 
research collaboration happens in a safe and secure way, but why would 
we prohibit it? Why would we not want to work together to find a cure 
for cancer?
  Ultimately, we cannot and must not follow the Chinese Communist 
Party's example and close ourselves off to the world and the Chinese 
people. That is what they do. That is not what America does.
  Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LUNA. Madam Chair, Communism, as well as any country that 
embraces that ideology, is a cancer upon this world and sometimes a 
guillotine is the only solution.
  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to support this 
incredible piece of legislation, and if you don't, that is on you.
  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Chair, I think the comments made by my 
colleague were perfectly appropriate. We have to deal with China and a 
whole series of issues, but to say that we should not collaborate with 
them on basic scientific research, that as was bluntly stated, could 
literally help us cure cancer is not something that is in our best 
interest.
  We also have to realize that China is a major factor in the world. We 
would like to get to a more peaceful relationship with them. Cutting 
off all contact doesn't make sense. Even at the height of the Cold War 
when we were aggressively trying to stand up to the Soviet Union, a 
bipartisan group of legislators kept dialogue up between the two 
countries.
  Madam Chair, I agree with my colleague that this amendment goes too 
far and I urge opposition.
  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I 
have remaining?
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1\1/2\ minutes remaining.

                              {time}  1430

  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the 
gentlewoman from San Diego, California (Ms. Jacobs).
  Ms. JACOBS. Madam Chair, this is another amendment that is 
fearmongering about China when Republicans are continuing to actually 
undermine our national security by restricting and banning abortion.
  Our servicemembers volunteered to serve in our armed services. They 
didn't volunteer to give up their reproductive rights.
  I am thankful that DOD has taken steps to support servicemembers and 
their dependents' reproductive freedom by covering the travel and 
transportation costs for abortion and fertility care in the post-Roe 
era.
  Let's be clear: DOD's travel policy is consistent with the law. We 
shouldn't reverse this progress and take away our servicemembers' 
freedom when they have already sacrificed so much for us.
  In the 1 year since the Supreme Court struck down the constitutional 
right to an abortion, 20 States have restricted or banned abortion. 
This decision has disproportionately burdened our military families, 
who don't often choose where they are stationed. They can't freely take 
off days from work. Many can't afford to travel thousands of miles and 
pay out of pocket to receive the care they need and deserve, all 
because of the current statutory ban on DOD providing abortion 
services, which I strongly oppose.
  That is why DOD's travel policy has been so important. As one of the 
few women of reproductive age in Congress, I know how important access 
to abortion and fertility care is to our health, freedom, economic 
security, and empowerment.
  Taking away these fundamental rights doesn't just hurt these 
individuals. It hurts our military readiness, recruitment and 
retention, and morale, putting our national security in jeopardy.
  With many people having zero access to abortion services where they 
are stationed, our military's ability to adapt to evolving conflicts 
and challenges has been very compromised.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) consistent with section 1093 of title 10, United States 
     Code, the Department of Defense may not use any funds for 
     abortions except where the life of the mother would be 
     endangered if the fetus were carried to term or in a case in 
     which the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or 
     incest;
       (2) the Secretary of Defense has no legal authority to 
     implement any policies in which funds are to be used for such 
     purpose; and
       (3) the Department of Defense Memorandum titled ``Ensuring 
     Access to Reproductive Health Care'', dated October 20, 2022, 
     is therefore unlawful and must be rescinded.
       (b) Repeal of Memorandum.--
       (1) Repeal.--The Department of Defense memorandum titled 
     ``Ensuring Access to Reproductive Health Care'', dated 
     October 20, 2022, shall have no force or effect.
       (2) Prohibition on availability of funds to carry out 
     memorandum.--No funds may be obligated or expended to carry 
     out the memorandum specified in paragraph (1) or any 
     successor to such memorandum.
       (c) Prohibition.--Section 1093 of title 10, United States 
     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
     subsection:
       ``(c) Prohibition on Payment or Reimbursement of Certain 
     Fees.--(1) The Secretary of Defense may not pay for or 
     reimburse any fees or expenses, including travel expenses, 
     relating to a health-care professional gaining a license in a 
     State if the purpose of gaining such license is to provide 
     abortion services.
       ``(2) In this subsection:
       ``(A) The term `health-care professional' means a member of 
     the armed forces, civilian employee of the Department of 
     Defense, personal services contractor under section 1091 of 
     this title, or other individual who provides health care at a 
     military medical treatment facility.
       ``(B) The term `license' has the meaning given that term in 
     section 1094 of this title.''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Jackson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Chair, on behalf of myself, my fellow Texan Chip Roy, and over 
70 cosponsors, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in strong support of 
my amendment to repeal the Department of Defense's illegal and immoral 
abortion policy.
  In the wake of the Supreme Court's historic Dobbs decision 
overturning Roe v. Wade, the Biden administration immediately set out 
to sidestep the Court's ruling and circumvent the law wherever 
possible.
  The Biden administration has encouraged every Federal agency to 
create rules and adopt policies that not only expand abortion access 
but also leave American taxpayers on the hook to subsidize abortion 
services.
  As evidence of this, in October of last year, the Secretary of 
Defense released a memo titled: ``Ensuring Access to Reproductive 
Health Care.'' This memo outlined the steps taken by the Department in 
order to use taxpayer dollars to provide servicemembers and their 
dependents access to abortions and allows for taxpayer dollars to be 
used so that healthcare providers can obtain the licensing required to 
perform such procedures.
  According to its illegal policy, which is now in place, DOD can and 
will reimburse travel expenses for servicemembers and their dependents 
who travel specifically to obtain an abortion in another State. The 
Department of Defense will also reimburse any associated fees for 
healthcare professionals seeking to be licensed in another State for 
the purpose of performing abortions--all on the taxpayers' dime.
  Last year, immediately after DOD started this unconstitutional and 
illegal process, Congressman Roy and I got to work on addressing this 
issue and developed a bill to right this wrong.
  This illegal Biden-endorsed policy has no place in our military. 
Taxpayer money provided to DOD is intended to provide for our national 
defense and our national security, not to promote and support the Biden 
administration's radical and immoral pro-abortion agenda.
  As mentioned, regardless of your political or personal stance on 
abortion, this policy is in direct violation of Federal law, 
specifically 10 U.S.C. 1093, which restricts funds made available to 
the DOD from being used for abortions.
  No doubt, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will insist 
that taxpayer dollars are not directly funding abortions, thereby 
rendering the current policy legally sound. This is an absolutely 
misleading claim. This taxpayer money is going directly to support 
abortions, and anyone in this Chamber who says differently is blatantly 
lying to the American people.
  Taxpayer funding of travel for abortion is, in fact, taxpayer-funded 
abortion. Abortion is the sole reason for these travel expenses, and 
this is in clear violation of existing law.
  My Democratic colleagues want to blame me, Senator Tuberville, and my 
colleagues like Congressman Roy for jeopardizing readiness. However, it 
is the Biden administration that has sidestepped existing law and given 
the Department permission to take this illegal action.
  This has left us with no choice but to take corrective measures and 
pass additional legislation. The days of the radical left ignoring the 
law and pushing their destructive social agenda in the military are 
done.
  I absolutely will not waver in my defense of the rule of law, 
therefore ensuring that taxpayer money is not used to kill innocent 
babies and, in doing so, also ensuring that our military servicemembers 
can focus on their jobs that they have in front of them and their 
families instead of being used for the political gain of the Biden 
administration.
  This amendment has over 70 cosponsors because we all recognize that 
the DOD is carrying out an illegal policy that is divisive, immoral, 
and does nothing to provide for our national defense or promote our 
national security.
  Madam Chair, I thank my friend, Congressman Chip Roy, for co-leading 
this amendment with me, for being a relentless defender of the law, and 
for being a true warrior in protecting the life of the unborn.
  I also thank the Military Personnel Subcommittee chairman,   Jim 
Banks, for his support of my amendment and his work on readying our 
servicemembers for the real threats that they face.
  Lastly, I thank Chairman Rogers for creating the strongest defense 
bill I have seen here in my time in Congress.
  Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment 
to repeal this outrageous and illegal policy and prevent any similar 
policy in the future.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Chair, I rise today in vehement opposition to the amendment 
proposed by Representative Jackson.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to thank the troops 
and talk about honoring their sacrifice, and that is all, frankly, 
empty words and broken promises if this amendment passes.
  This amendment puts servicewomen and military families' lives at risk 
by denying the basic right to travel for healthcare that is no longer 
available where they are stationed.
  Now that Iowa passed anti-abortion restrictions, 46 percent of 
servicewomen do not have access to abortion care. This would enact a 
dangerous healthcare travel ban.

[[Page H3507]]

  Servicemembers signed up to put their lives on the line for our 
freedoms, our national values, and our constitutional rights. They did 
not sign up to put their lives on the line or their spouses' lives on 
the line because they cannot get access to basic care.

  I was an officer in the Navy. What I learned was that good leaders 
protect their squadron. They don't abandon them in favor of their own 
politics or agenda.
  How am I supposed to recommend to young girls in my district that 
they should attend a service academy like I did when we know this 
amendment would mean that they would be signing away their right to 
basic healthcare?
  This amendment makes our servicewomen pawns in the majority's extreme 
agenda and is a steppingstone to larger bans, restrictions, and 
wholesale disregard for women's healthcare in America.
  Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
Houlahan), my good friend and a tireless champion for servicewomen.
  Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Chair, I thank Representative Sherrill for 
yielding me time.
  Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to this harmful and dangerous 
amendment, a back door to a national ban on abortion.
  I also rise saddened and frustrated that we find ourselves here in 
this legislative body deciding whether or not we trust our women in 
uniform and our military families to make healthcare decisions for 
themselves.
  Let me say loud and clear, as someone who has worn the uniform, who 
had a child as an Active-Duty member, and who has a uterus, unlike many 
who are opining on this subject, I trust women to make the best 
decisions that they are able to for their own health and their 
families' health.
  It is insulting that we have to stand here and ask our colleagues to 
acknowledge our servicemembers' and military family members' bodily 
autonomy.
  I grew up in a military family, moving dozens of times. When I 
graduated and when the time came, I also raised my right hand.
  Today, that same woman stands before you perplexed. Why would any 
woman want to enlist when her fundamental freedoms and those of her 
family are no longer her own?
  The percentage of Active-Duty servicemembers who have no or severely 
restricted access to abortion is now 46 percent. I strongly urge my 
colleagues to oppose this amendment.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I thank Ms. Houlahan for her comments, and 
I strongly associate myself with the gentlewoman's remarks.
  Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin), 
one of our strongest advocates for women's healthcare.
  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Chair, I rise today with my colleagues in 
opposition to this amendment, and I want to make sure that everyone 
understands what this amendment means. This amendment, plus other 
amendments that are the exact same in the Appropriations Committee, 
plus the same hold that is going on by Senator Tuberville, are putting 
culture wars ahead of national security.
  We understand that Mr. Jackson, the author of this amendment, is from 
Texas and that he supports an outright ban on all abortions, including 
for rape and for incest. We understand that he doesn't trust women. He 
certainly can't claim to care about recruitment into the military.
  What we cannot miss, though, is that this is part and parcel of a 
goal from a party that wants a Federal ban on abortion. It wasn't 
enough that we overturned Roe in our Supreme Court, and it doesn't 
matter if States like Michigan vote on their ballot to preserve Roe. 
The majority will not stop until there is a Federal ban where it won't 
matter what happens in States.
  Madam Chair, I stand in strong opposition to this amendment.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I couldn't agree more with the 
gentlewoman, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time 
remains.
  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Tenney). The gentleman has 1 minute remaining.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. Rogers).
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.
  DOD's abortion travel policy is a flagrant violation of the 
congressional intent and our Nation's moral principles. This policy is 
part of the Biden administration's politicization of the military. It 
is completely unnecessary, and it is clearly unlawful.
  Madam Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. Luna).
  Mrs. LUNA. Madam Chair, I want to start out by saying that I am a 
United States Air Force veteran and a woman who has been elected to 
Congress while pregnant who supports this because of the fact that not 
only does it completely attack our ability to be military ready, but 
when you are advocating for a servicemember to have a child ripped from 
their womb, they can't deploy.
  To say that this is constitutional in their argument and to say that 
Republicans are somehow attacking women in service because we support 
this is not only a lie, but it completely just destroys everything that 
this military stands for.
  Not only are there religious objections to taxpayers funding this 
type of stuff, but to say as a military servicemember that you would be 
somehow hurting someone's rights in the military because you stand with 
life is pretty bizarre to me.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Escobar), who is someone who not only fights for women in Congress but 
fights against her home State's draconian laws.
  Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, 
which, make no mistake about it, is the Republican Party's backdoor 
effort to create a national abortion ban.
  I represent El Paso, Texas, which is home to Fort Bliss, one of our 
country's premier military installations. I serve on the House Armed 
Services Committee, and I am a mother of two.

  My colleagues want to ensure that the enlisted women of the United 
States military and their family members who live in Republican States 
where abortion has been banned are forced to carry a pregnancy to term, 
even in the case of rape and incest.
  Unlike my Republican colleagues, I trust women, and unlike my 
Republican colleagues, I believe women have a place in the United 
States military and that it is our job to support them.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from New Jersey has the only time 
remaining.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I yield the remaining time to the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), who is my friend and a valued 
colleague and partner in this effort.
  Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to this extreme and 
misguided amendment.
  In Iraq and Afghanistan, I fought alongside servicemembers from every 
race, gender, and political affiliation, and we had each other's backs. 
We still do. So, I will not sit quietly while people attack the rights 
of women who have stood up to serve this country. We owe them better 
than this.
  It is extreme, misguided, and inconsistent with the values of our 
Nation and our military.
  Madam Chair, as a standard-bearer of those values, I urge my 
colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Chair, I rise to express my outrage at 
the far-right minority in this Congress attempting to force their 
extreme anti-abortion agenda onto what should be a bipartisan bill.
  We all know the Dobbs decision last year decimated abortion access, 
including for over half of active-duty female servicemembers. In 
response, the Department of Defense announced important changes to 
safeguard reproductive health care access.
  Amendment No. 5 aims to revoke those protections and push 
reproductive care further out of reach.
  It is a shame that MAGA Republicans can trust women to defend our 
nation on battlefields but refuse to trust them to make their own 
healthcare decisions.
  The military offers vast healthcare and educational benefits to 
service members. Women

continue to be the fastest growing demographic in the military, but 
restricting their rights tells them they're not welcome.
  If my colleagues care about personal freedom, they will vote NO on 
this amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will 
be postponed.

                              {time}  1445

  The Chair understands that amendment No. 6 will not be offered.
  The Chair understands that amendment No. 7 will not be offered.
  The Chair understands that amendment No. 8 will not be offered.
  The Chair understands that amendment No. 9 will not be offered.


               Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Rosendale

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       In subtitle A of title VII, add at the end the following:

     SEC. 714. PROHIBITION ON COVERAGE OF CERTAIN SEX REASSIGNMENT 
                   SURGERIES AND RELATED SERVICES UNDER TRICARE 
                   PROGRAM.

       Chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by 
     inserting after section 1076f the following new section (and 
     conforming the table of sections at the beginning of such 
     chapter accordingly):

     ``Sec. 1076g. TRICARE program: prohibition on coverage and 
       furnishment of certain sex reassignment surgeries and 
       related services

       ``(a) Prohibition.--The medical care to which individuals 
     are entitled to under this chapter does not include the 
     services described in subsection (b) and the Secretary of 
     Defense may not furnish any such service.
       ``(b) Services Described.--The services described in this 
     subsection are the following:
       ``(1) Sex reassignment surgeries furnished for the purpose 
     of the gender alteration of a transgender individual.
       ``(2) Hormone treatments furnished for the purpose of the 
     gender alteration of a transgender individual.''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Montana (Mr. Rosendale) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana.
  Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Chair, today I rise in support of my amendment 
No. 10.
  Amendment No. 10 is a very simple amendment. It would prohibit 
TRICARE from covering sex reassignment surgeries and hormone treatment 
for transgender individuals. The most recent numbers tell us that the 
Department of Defense has performed over 240 gender reassignment 
surgeries, costing taxpayers approximately $3.1 million.
  Unfortunately, that is just a small part of the cost associated with 
this transaction. The Department has spent over $11.5 million on 
psychotherapy. That is it; psychotherapy for servicemembers with gender 
dysphoria.
  The amount of funds paid out for this psychotherapy shows that the 
surgery alone cannot solve the root issue for these individuals. This 
does nothing to help our troops continue to be the most effective 
fighting force on Earth and is nothing but a distraction and a waste of 
valuable taxpayer dollars. The government has no business funding these 
procedures on the taxpayer's dime.
  The question that must be asked is whether having trans individuals 
makes the United States a more lethal force and whether it helps 
recruit the best and most effective talent for the United States 
military. The answer to that is a clear and resounding no.
  A report commissioned by General Mattis found that servicemembers

                       PARENTS BILL OF RIGHTS ACT


                             General Leave

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 5.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 241 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 5.
  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Flood) to preside 
over the Committee of the Whole.

                              {time}  1420


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 5) to ensure the rights of parents are honored and protected in 
the Nation's public schools, with Mr. Flood in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the 
first time.
  General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 2 
hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce or their 
respective designees.
  The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Scott) each will control 1 hour.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today to recognize the profound importance of H.R. 
5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and what it means for families 
across the country.
  Over the past several years, parents witnessed the consequences of 
lessons taught in classrooms firsthand. Math scores declined by the 
largest margin ever, and reading scores plummeted to the lowest levels 
in over three decades. These results are devastating.
  Teachers' unions and education bureaucrats worked to push progressive 
politics in classrooms while keeping parents in the dark. The Parents 
Bill of Rights Act aims to end that and shine a light on what is 
happening in schools. This bill will reaffirm a parent's right to 
review course curriculum, meet with the child's teacher, and be heard 
at school board meetings without fear of reprisal.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem convinced 
Republicans are using this bill to punish teachers or push an extreme 
rightwing agenda. This is false.
  Our education system is spiraling out of control as parents are 
pushed further outside the classroom. This bill will restore the role 
of parents in schools and provide new mechanisms to promote parent-
teacher partnerships.
  When parents are involved in their child's education, students 
thrive. That is the guiding principle of this bill. With the Parents 
Bill of Rights Act, Republicans will help parents steer the education 
of their children back onto the correct path where they can learn the 
skills they need for a lifetime of success.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the politics over parents 
act.
  First, let me be clear. House Democrats believe parental engagement 
is central to student success. Parental engagement in schools is 
closely linked to better student behavior, higher academic achievement, 
and enhanced social skills.
  Unfortunately, the politics over parents act does not take meaningful 
steps to increase or support parental engagement. In fact, it lists so-
called rights and then declares that this allows the parents to control 
what is taught. Let's be clear: There is nothing in the bill to give 
parents the right to dictate what their children are taught.
  Instead, this bill is one of many attempts by Republican politicians 
to give a vocal minority the power to try to impose their beliefs on 
all parents and students. This extreme education agenda has real 
consequences for students and educators.
  According to PEN America, over 2,500 books were banned in schools 
during the school year 2021-2022, and nearly 140 additional book bans 
have taken effect since July 2022.
  Let me just list some of the books that Republican politicians have 
gotten banned under the guise of parental rights: ``Diary of a Young 
Girl,'' the stories of a Holocaust survivor, by Anne Frank; ``The Kite 
Runner,'' a novel on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, by Khaled 
Hosseini; ``Beloved,'' a novel about slaves during the Civil War, by 
Toni Morrison; and on and on. Books like that have been banned because 
of efforts like what we have before us today.
  Let's be clear. These books are taught at age-appropriate levels. If 
you have a problem with it, you should call the librarian. Yet, 
Republican politicians are actually having them removed from classrooms 
and school libraries.
  Simply put, the politics over parents act is an educational gag order 
across the Nation which will prevent students from learning and prevent 
teachers from teaching. These efforts seek to score political points 
and scare parents into thinking that schools do not have their best 
interests at heart. Instead, we should be talking about the support 
that schools and families actually need to improve parent-teacher 
engagement.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the politics over 
parents act and join House Democrats in an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to deliver real solutions to build partnerships between 
schools and families.

  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Louisiana (Ms. Letlow).
  Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Chair, I rise today to join my voice with millions of 
American parents as the House considers H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of 
Rights Act.
  H.R. 5 is about one simple and fundamental principle: Parents should 
always have a seat at the table when it comes to their child's 
education.
  We believe that learning is a partnership between a family and their 
child's teachers. This bill is the vehicle by which we can put parents 
and educators together at the same table to have a productive dialogue.
  This bill is not complex or complicated, nor should it be partisan or 
polarizing. Contrary to what you may hear from my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, it is not an attack on our hardworking 
teachers, who will always be the heroes in my eyes. It is not an 
attempt to have Congress dictate the curriculum or determine the books 
in the library. Instead, this bill aims to bring more transparency and 
accountability to education, allowing parents to be informed and, when 
they have questions and concerns, to lawfully bring them to their local 
school boards.
  Over the past 2 years, we have seen too many instances where rather 
than opening their doors to welcome parents in as partners, some 
schools instead slammed them shut and said that government bureaucrats 
know what is best for our children.
  Parents across this country have overwhelmingly spoken out that they 
have had enough. They want a seat at the table because, at the end of 
the day, these are our children, not the government's.

[[Page H1349]]

  Mr. Chair, I worked in education before I came to Congress, and I am 
also a mom. I have seen firsthand how when you educate a child, you 
give them a future.
  We know that when parents are involved, it is the students who 
succeed. We also know that when a family is shut out of their child's 
education, it will lead to disastrous results.

                              {time}  1430

  Mr. Chair, let us give parents that voice in the learning process. 
Let schools open the doors and welcome them in as partners. Let us work 
together to build a brighter future for America's children.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), the ranking member on the Higher 
Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee.
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 
5. As an educator, I believe parent voices should be honored in 
schools. All educators believe this.
  We know that this bill is not about that at all. We have always had 
parents involved in our schools, so stop being foolish and divisive. We 
always need their input.
  This bill is nothing more than a talking point of the extreme MAGA 
agenda that will hurt children and hurt our schools. Let's face it--
there has been a movement to eliminate public education since the 1954 
Brown v. Board of Education decision.
  With the election of our President 7 years ago, it pulled the scab of 
a wound that never healed. Now it is an open, gaping wound, and it is 
out of control. They are throwing everything at public schools but the 
kitchen sink: vouchers, excessive testing, poorly paid teachers, 
banning books, and now they are trying to drive a wedge and create an 
antagonistic relationship between schools and their parents. How 
pathetic. How dreadful.
  Parents love teachers. Everybody loves teachers. Every parent has an 
``I love and remember a teacher'' story. How disgraceful that we want 
to terrorize the very people who love our children, keep them safe, and 
educate them for over 8 hours daily. Our teachers are sacrificial 
lambs.
  You will never eliminate public schools. We will fight you as long as 
it takes. This is all that the little children who look like me have. 
Public schools are the bedrock of this Nation.
  Let me tell you what a parent's bill of rights should include. I will 
call it the parents' 10 commandments:
  Thou shalt restore the Child Tax Credit; provide free, hot breakfast 
and lunch; provide free pre-K and free community college.
  Thou shalt end the school-to-prison pipeline; put a nurse in every 
school; offer after-school activities; provide intensive counseling 
services, particularly to address school shootings.
  Thou shalt offer parents the right to improve their education and job 
skills, love and respect every child's individuality, guarantee that 
every child's teacher will make a minimum of $60,000 a year.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Bean), chair of the Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary 
Education Subcommittee.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Chair, should parents have the right to be 
involved in their child's education?
  That is the question before us. Seventy-two percent of Americans have 
answered ``yes'' to that question. Parents should be and want to be 
involved in their child's education.
  According to numerous studies, students who have involved parents 
have better behavior, better grades, better attendance, and develop a 
lifelong love of learning, which is the key to long-term success.
  Today, American parents are fed up, largely because they have 
experienced 2 years of school closures, misguided COVID policies, 
disastrous remote learning, and a curriculum focused on what is woke 
rather than what is essential academic instruction. They have been 
branded ``domestic terrorists'' for speaking out at school boards. Some 
were even arrested for having the nerve to plead with school boards 
about the safety of their child at school.
  Mr. Chair, it is time to re-welcome parents back into education. It 
is time for parents to have the right to know what is going on in 
American education today. That is why I--and I encourage everybody--to 
support H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, critical legislation 
that empowers parents and prioritizes the needs of students over 
entrenched special interest groups.
  Today, this body has an extraordinary opportunity to reclaim the 
moral high ground in America and usher in a newer era of K-12 education 
that empowers parents, protects kids, and expands educational freedom.
  American parents have said they want to be a part of their children's 
education. It is time for this body to say ``yes'' and support parents.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the ranking member of the Early 
Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction of the bill.
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 
5, which should be called the politics over parents act.
  After spending 15 years as a very involved public school parent, I 
can say without hesitation that I strongly support parental involvement 
in education. You won't meet a Member on this side of the aisle that 
disagrees with that. The bill before us today misses the mark.
  This could have been an opportunity to address the real challenges 
facing education, to make changes that would involve parents in a 
constructive way, and also make a positive difference in education. I 
am disappointed that we aren't doing that.
  House Democrats have shown time and time again that we are committed 
to providing all parents--including those who traditionally face 
barriers to engagement--with meaningful involvement in their kids' 
schools. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Democratic 
Party is the party of parental rights and family values.
  We have put forward a substantive plan that will actually increase 
the frequency, quality, and accessibility of parental involvement and 
engagement in schools; a substantive plan that invests in evidence-
based models and support systems that have been shown to increase 
family engagement and improve student achievement; a substantive plan 
that encourages parents to be partners, not adversaries, in their 
children's education; a substantive plan that roots out discrimination 
based on race, disability, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or 
gender identity in our public schools; a substantive plan that, unlike 
H.R. 5, doesn't carry dangerous, authoritarian undertones encouraging 
book bans, discouraging the teaching of scientifically and historically 
accurate curricula, and leading to the micromanagement of the work of 
educators.

  We welcome a conversation about how to empower parents, and urge our 
friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle to abandon their 
politically motivated attacks on schoolteachers and students. We should 
instead be working together on these issues in a bipartisan manner. Our 
Nation's students and families deserve that.
  We need more parents, including those from diverse backgrounds, to 
feel included, supported, engaged, and welcomed at their kids' school. 
This bill does not even begin to do that.
  I am leading more than 45 of our colleagues on a Bill of Rights for 
Students and Parents, a resolution that is supported by more than 250 
education, civil rights, and parents' groups, including the National 
PTA.
  I have heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that 
history will judge us on how we respond to the needs of students and 
families at this moment, and I agree with them.
  Will we succumb to an extremist, discriminatory, narrow-minded, anti-
public-education agenda, or will we work together to advance 
commonsense, meaningful policies that will support parents, students, 
and educators?
  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to take the approach that 
still sees public education as the great equalizer for all students 
regardless of who they are or where they are from, essential to our 
communities, the economy, and our democratic Republic.
  Please join me in rejecting this bill.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a statement from the National PTA 
in opposition to H.R. 5.


[[Page H1350]]


       Dear Representative Bobby Scott: National PTA and our 
     network of millions of parents and educators across the 
     country urge you to support adoption of the Bonamici 
     Substitute Amendment and oppose the underlying legislation, 
     H.R. 5, on the House Floor tomorrow.
       PTA opposes the underlying bill, H.R. 5, because it has the 
     potential to cause significant harm to children and families. 
     If passed as written, H.R. 5 could:
       Prevent mental health support for students in need;
       Limit access to learning-enhancing technology and 
     educational materials;
       Lead to inappropriate and harmful book bans and curriculum 
     censorship;
       Create confusion for school staff and burdensome opt-in 
     requirements for families;
       Impair relationships between educators and parents; and
       Undermine efforts to create safe, welcoming, supportive, 
     and inclusive learning environments for all students and 
     families.
       PTA supports Representative Bonamici's Substitute Amendment 
     to H.R. 5 as the ONLY PATH forward to ensuring supports and 
     services are in place for true family-school partnerships. We 
     stand behind our National Standards for Family-School 
     Partnerships that have been in place for over 20 years. The 
     Substitute Amendment provides the opportunity for meaningful 
     and inclusive family engagement in K-12 education and if 
     adopted would replace the current H.R. 5 and enable our 
     Nation's public schools to:
       Create a parent coordinator position in public schools;
       Reinforce existing parents' rights under federal law;
       Prohibit the federal government from curriculum censorship 
     and banning books; and
       Invest in full-service community schools and Statewide 
     Family Engagement Centers Program (the new authorization 
     level of $60 million would allow all states to participate).
       As the Nation's oldest and largest child advocacy 
     association, we know what meaningful family engagement looks 
     like and what parents want from their policymakers. We ask 
     you to join us in supporting the Bonamici Substitute 
     Amendment and opposing the underlying bill, H.R. 5 on the 
     House Floor. We thank you for consideration of this request 
     and if you have any questions, please reach out to our 
     Director of Government Affairs, Kate Clabaugh.

  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman's time has expired. The gentlewoman is no 
longer recognized.


                         Parliamentary Inquiry

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Was the gentlewoman's request to introduce a 
statement recognized?
  The CHAIR. That request is covered under general leave.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the chair of the Agriculture Committee.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong 
support of the Parents Bill of Rights Act. This legislation is just one 
of many promises we intend to keep in our ``Commitment to America.''
  As a recovering school board member, I know firsthand the importance 
of hearing from parents and encouraging them to be engaged in their 
child's education.
  The Parents Bill of Rights Act provides parents an expanded 
opportunity to engage with their children and the teachers who educate 
them. This bill implements clear, commonsense protections allowing 
parents to easily review curriculum information, academic standards, 
and see how schools are spending our tax dollars.
  Parents deserve the right to be heard and should be able to raise 
concerns and address their school board without fear of harassment or 
retribution.
  This bill includes simple protections to keep our children safe, from 
protecting their privacy to requiring parents to be notified of violent 
activity in the school.
  As a graduate of the public school system and having raised three 
sons in the very same school district, I know parental involvement is 
critical to fostering a successful educational environment.
  Mr. Chair, quite simply, this bill is common sense. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation that ensures parents are at the 
center of their child's educational experience.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the 
Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
politics over parents act as a member of the Education and the 
Workforce Committee, as a member of the LGBTQ community, but above all, 
as a teacher.
  I am an educator and I know how important parental involvement is. 
All parents, including the parents of LGBTQ kids, have rights. They 
have rights to send their children to schools where they will be 
affirmed, protected, and free from harassment, and given the 
opportunity to thrive. They have a right to be free from bullying and 
humiliation.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from a million 
MomsRising.

  So-Called `Parents Bill of Rights' Is All Wrong for America's Moms, 
 Families--A Toxic Plan That Will Create More Division, Damage to Our 
                          Kids and Communities

       Statement of Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, Executive Director 
     and CEO of MomsRising, the online and on-the-ground 
     organization of more than one million mothers and their 
     families, on the so-called `Parents Bill of Rights' (H.R. 5) 
     House Republicans are poised to pass this week:
       ``The badly misnamed `Parents Bill of Rights' the House GOP 
     plans to vote on this week is all wrong for America's moms, 
     kids, families, and educators. It is a recipe for censorship, 
     bullying and book bans, and for division based on race, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, masquerading as a 
     bill of rights. If it were to become law, the Parents Bill of 
     Rights would create more division by pitting educators 
     against parents. It would do enormous damage to our kids, 
     schools and communities.
       ``America's moms want schools to be safe and inclusive and 
     to value diversity; for parents to be respectful; and for 
     educators to be able to be honest about their identities and 
     allowed to teach our country's truths, good and bad, and the 
     values that got us to where we are today. We want our 
     children to learn about the history and obstacles faced, and 
     overcome, by members of our Black, Brown, AAPI, Native 
     American, immigrant, religious-minority, LGBTQ+, and other 
     communities. We want our students to be able to access 
     unbiased health information. We want all our youth, 
     regardless of income, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, to be safe and 
     included in schools that prepare them to contribute to and 
     succeed in our society.
       ``And we want a society that rejects `us vs. them' and puts 
     in place the caregiving and other supports that will allow 
     all families to succeed. MomsRising has more than a million 
     members and we have been working closely with moms in every 
     state for more than a decade. What this country's moms want 
     from Congress is affordable child, elder and disability care; 
     paid family and medical leave; fair pay; health care and 
     medications we can afford; vastly improved maternal health 
     care for all of us; the ability to make our own decisions 
     about if, when and how many children to have; and laws that 
     will end the scourge of gun violence and keep our children, 
     streets, schools and communities safe.
       ``Coming soon, we will release the Moms Rising for Freedom 
     Agenda with ten key policies lawmakers should support that 
     moms across the Nation really want, instead of the divisive 
     and harmful policies in the `Parents Bill of Rights.' That is 
     how we build a society in which we can all flourish and 
     thrive.''
  Mr. TAKANO. In committee, my Republican colleagues have preached 
about parents' God-given rights. I will tell you now that children have 
a God-given right not to be physically or emotionally harmed.
  As a teacher, I know of instances where children were outed by staff, 
and as a consequence those children faced severe punishment at home. 
One student was viciously beaten by his father and transferred out of a 
district after his family was informed that he was caught being 
physically affectionate with another boy.
  Imagine the situation in which educators are placed when government 
requires them to out their student to an unsupportive family. I will 
tell you what happens to those kids:
  73 percent of LGBTQ youth report anxiety.
  58 percent of them report depression.
  40 percent of homeless youth are LGBTQ, and
  46 percent, nearly half of them, have seriously considered suicide.
  Good teachers care about their kids. Good teachers know that a 
relationship with parents is important. But when a home is not safe for 
LGBTQ kids, school becomes their safe place, and teachers need to be 
their cheerleaders, not their first bullies.
  This bill forces good teachers to do bad things. It alienates 
students from their parents. It outs kids. It forces kids back into the 
closet. It is a fundamental invasion of privacy that puts children in 
danger.
  In the first 3 months that this Congress has been in session, this is 
what

[[Page H1351]]

Republicans have chosen to spend our time and taxpayer dollars on. The 
so-called Parents Bill of Rights Act is the exact type of Big 
Government overreach my colleagues across the aisle proclaim they are 
against, and puts the cost of their pursuit of political gain on the 
backs of students and teachers.
  This is worse than simply bad legislation. It is a concerted attack 
on children, parents, and teachers.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the bill.

                              {time}  1445

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the 
Parents Bill of Rights Act. I thank Representative Letlow and Chair 
Foxx for their leadership in defending the God-given rights of parents 
and protecting kids as well.
  Parental involvement in their children's education is paramount to a 
student's success. However, in recent years, we have seen a push by 
some to exclude parents from their children's education. This is why I 
recently introduced the PROTECT Kids Act with Senator Tim Scott which 
has been included as an amendment to H.R. 5.
  The PROTECT Kids Act would require any Department of Education-funded 
elementary or middle school to seek and acquire parental consent before 
changing their child's pronouns or preferred name on any school form.
  This provision is straightforward, common sense, and will safeguard 
the critical relationship between parents, schools, and children.
  When a child goes on a field trip or fails a test, their parents are 
told and are often required to sign an acknowledgment or a permission 
slip.
  Why should relatively small things require notification but something 
as significant as a child's pronouns or a change in accommodations can 
be withheld from the people who raise and love them?
  Recent polling shows this has the broad support of the American 
people. Three-quarters of Americans believe schools should be required 
to obtain consent from parents.
  Parents have a fundamental right to raise and educate their children 
how they choose. We must pass the Parents Bill of Rights Act to help 
mitigate issues we have seen nationwide and to support parents who need 
the support to do right by their kids as well.
  On this side of the aisle, we believe this is the right way to go, 
and we believe that in the end it will promote education, family, and 
individualism as well.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is a member of the 
Committee on Education and the Workforce.
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, Congress should be supporting parents, 
students, and teachers, not advancing this politics over parents act 
which would punish teachers for giving history lessons, ban books, and 
sow hate and divisiveness against trans kids.
  Parents have the utmost confidence in their kids' teachers. When it 
comes to writing curricula, 76 percent of parents trust their child's 
school. But when it comes to writing laws, political gimmicks, like 
this bill, keep them from saying the same thing about this very body.
  Instead of manufacturing outrage over curricula and books, why don't 
we just listen?
  Mr. Chairman, 84 percent of parents would rather Congress give free 
school meals, and 79 percent want support for mental health services. 
In a survey of parents' top concerns by The Pew Charitable Trusts, 40 
percent said they were extremely or very worried about their children 
struggling with depression, 35 percent said they were concerned about 
bullying, and 22 percent were worried about their kids being shot.
  Not a single one of those issues on the top list of parental concerns 
is addressed in this bill. So don't tell me this is a parents' bill of 
rights. This is not addressing gun violence. It is not addressing 
mental health. It is not addressing childcare, pre-K, and all of the 
other things that would be a part of a parents' bill of rights.
  Instead, we are spending time on a bill that sows doubt about public 
education and our teachers and also targets our very vulnerable trans 
kids who are absolutely no threat to anyone in this body.
  Please understand that the provisions in this bill that out trans 
kids are cruel and dangerous. I say that as a mom of a trans kid. I was 
very embracing to my daughter when she came out, but not every family 
is. The reality is that 75 percent of trans kids experience 
discrimination and harassment.
  So why do Republicans want schools to require outing LGBTQ students?
  That does not make them better students.
  Congress has the constitutional authority to write laws. What a 
mockery and betrayal of that duty it would be to pass this stunt of a 
bill that doesn't address a single priority of parents, bans books, 
undermines teachers, and hurts our kids.
  Democrats are the party of parents and families. We reject this bill, 
and we commit to fighting for childcare, for universal pre-K, for a 
child tax credit, and for the ability of people to be free for who they 
are and express themselves.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two letters. One is from the 
National Education Association, and one is from the American Federation 
of Teachers.

                               National Education Association,

                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.
     U.S. House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 3 million members of 
     the National Education Association, dedicated and trusted 
     professionals who teach and support nearly 50 million 
     students in public schools across America, we urge you to 
     vote NO on H.R. 5. Votes related to this bill, including 
     extreme amendments that would create a national private 
     school voucher program, may be included in the NEA Report 
     Card for the 118th Congress.
       H.R. 5 is unnecessary and ignores the partnerships that 
     exist between parents and educators. Parents and guardians 
     already have the right and the opportunity to partner with 
     educators to ensure students have the learning opportunities, 
     resources, and support for success. Across America, parents 
     are strategizing with educators when children face hurdles 
     and celebrating with them when students achieve milestones, 
     volunteering at events, chaperoning field trips, leading 
     PTAs,",

include extraneous material on H.R. 5.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 241 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 5.
  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Flood) to preside 
over the Committee of the Whole.

                              {time}  1420


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 5) to ensure the rights of parents are honored and protected in 
the Nation's public schools, with Mr. Flood in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the 
first time.
  General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 2 
hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce or their 
respective designees.
  The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Scott) each will control 1 hour.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today to recognize the profound importance of H.R. 
5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and what it means for families 
across the country.
  Over the past several years, parents witnessed the consequences of 
lessons taught in classrooms firsthand. Math scores declined by the 
largest margin ever, and reading scores plummeted to the lowest levels 
in over three decades. These results are devastating.
  Teachers' unions and education bureaucrats worked to push progressive 
politics in classrooms while keeping parents in the dark. The Parents 
Bill of Rights Act aims to end that and shine a light on what is 
happening in schools. This bill will reaffirm a parent's right to 
review course curriculum, meet with the child's teacher, and be heard 
at school board meetings without fear of reprisal.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem convinced 
Republicans are using this bill to punish teachers or push an extreme 
rightwing agenda. This is false.
  Our education system is spiraling out of control as parents are 
pushed further outside the classroom. This bill will restore the role 
of parents in schools and provide new mechanisms to promote parent-
teacher partnerships.
  When parents are involved in their child's education, students 
thrive. That is the guiding principle of this bill. With the Parents 
Bill of Rights Act, Republicans will help parents steer the education 
of their children back onto the correct path where they can learn the 
skills they need for a lifetime of success.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the politics over parents 
act.
  First, let me be clear. House Democrats believe parental engagement 
is central to student success. Parental engagement in schools is 
closely linked to better student behavior, higher academic achievement, 
and enhanced social skills.
  Unfortunately, the politics over parents act does not take meaningful 
steps to increase or support parental engagement. In fact, it lists so-
called rights and then declares that this allows the parents to control 
what is taught. Let's be clear: There is nothing in the bill to give 
parents the right to dictate what their children are taught.
  Instead, this bill is one of many attempts by Republican politicians 
to give a vocal minority the power to try to impose their beliefs on 
all parents and students. This extreme education agenda has real 
consequences for students and educators.
  According to PEN America, over 2,500 books were banned in schools 
during the school year 2021-2022, and nearly 140 additional book bans 
have taken effect since July 2022.
  Let me just list some of the books that Republican politicians have 
gotten banned under the guise of parental rights: ``Diary of a Young 
Girl,'' the stories of a Holocaust survivor, by Anne Frank; ``The Kite 
Runner,'' a novel on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, by Khaled 
Hosseini; ``Beloved,'' a novel about slaves during the Civil War, by 
Toni Morrison; and on and on. Books like that have been banned because 
of efforts like what we have before us today.
  Let's be clear. These books are taught at age-appropriate levels. If 
you have a problem with it, you should call the librarian. Yet, 
Republican politicians are actually having them removed from classrooms 
and school libraries.
  Simply put, the politics over parents act is an educational gag order 
across the Nation which will prevent students from learning and prevent 
teachers from teaching. These efforts seek to score political points 
and scare parents into thinking that schools do not have their best 
interests at heart. Instead, we should be talking about the support 
that schools and families actually need to improve parent-teacher 
engagement.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the politics over 
parents act and join House Democrats in an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to deliver real solutions to build partnerships between 
schools and families.

  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Louisiana (Ms. Letlow).
  Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Chair, I rise today to join my voice with millions of 
American parents as the House considers H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of 
Rights Act.
  H.R. 5 is about one simple and fundamental principle: Parents should 
always have a seat at the table when it comes to their child's 
education.
  We believe that learning is a partnership between a family and their 
child's teachers. This bill is the vehicle by which we can put parents 
and educators together at the same table to have a productive dialogue.
  This bill is not complex or complicated, nor should it be partisan or 
polarizing. Contrary to what you may hear from my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, it is not an attack on our hardworking 
teachers, who will always be the heroes in my eyes. It is not an 
attempt to have Congress dictate the curriculum or determine the books 
in the library. Instead, this bill aims to bring more transparency and 
accountability to education, allowing parents to be informed and, when 
they have questions and concerns, to lawfully bring them to their local 
school boards.
  Over the past 2 years, we have seen too many instances where rather 
than opening their doors to welcome parents in as partners, some 
schools instead slammed them shut and said that government bureaucrats 
know what is best for our children.
  Parents across this country have overwhelmingly spoken out that they 
have had enough. They want a seat at the table because, at the end of 
the day, these are our children, not the government's.

  Mr. Chair, I worked in education before I came to Congress, and I am 
also a mom. I have seen firsthand how when you educate a child, you 
give them a future.
  We know that when parents are involved, it is the students who 
succeed. We also know that when a family is shut out of their child's 
education, it will lead to disastrous results.

                              {time}  1430

  Mr. Chair, let us give parents that voice in the learning process. 
Let schools open the doors and welcome them in as partners. Let us work 
together to build a brighter future for America's children.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), the ranking member on the Higher 
Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee.
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 
5. As an educator, I believe parent voices should be honored in 
schools. All educators believe this.
  We know that this bill is not about that at all. We have always had 
parents involved in our schools, so stop being foolish and divisive. We 
always need their input.
  This bill is nothing more than a talking point of the extreme MAGA 
agenda that will hurt children and hurt our schools. Let's face it--
there has been a movement to eliminate public education since the 1954 
Brown v. Board of Education decision.
  With the election of our President 7 years ago, it pulled the scab of 
a wound that never healed. Now it is an open, gaping wound, and it is 
out of control. They are throwing everything at public schools but the 
kitchen sink: vouchers, excessive testing, poorly paid teachers, 
banning books, and now they are trying to drive a wedge and create an 
antagonistic relationship between schools and their parents. How 
pathetic. How dreadful.
  Parents love teachers. Everybody loves teachers. Every parent has an 
``I love and remember a teacher'' story. How disgraceful that we want 
to terrorize the very people who love our children, keep them safe, and 
educate them for over 8 hours daily. Our teachers are sacrificial 
lambs.
  You will never eliminate public schools. We will fight you as long as 
it takes. This is all that the little children who look like me have. 
Public schools are the bedrock of this Nation.
  Let me tell you what a parent's bill of rights should include. I will 
call it the parents' 10 commandments:
  Thou shalt restore the Child Tax Credit; provide free, hot breakfast 
and lunch; provide free pre-K and free community college.
  Thou shalt end the school-to-prison pipeline; put a nurse in every 
school; offer after-school activities; provide intensive counseling 
services, particularly to address school shootings.
  Thou shalt offer parents the right to improve their education and job 
skills, love and respect every child's individuality, guarantee that 
every child's teacher will make a minimum of $60,000 a year.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Bean), chair of the Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary 
Education Subcommittee.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Chair, should parents have the right to be 
involved in their child's education?
  That is the question before us. Seventy-two percent of Americans have 
answered ``yes'' to that question. Parents should be and want to be 
involved in their child's education.
  According to numerous studies, students who have involved parents 
have better behavior, better grades, better attendance, and develop a 
lifelong love of learning, which is the key to long-term success.
  Today, American parents are fed up, largely because they have 
experienced 2 years of school closures, misguided COVID policies, 
disastrous remote learning, and a curriculum focused on what is woke 
rather than what is essential academic instruction. They have been 
branded ``domestic terrorists'' for speaking out at school boards. Some 
were even arrested for having the nerve to plead with school boards 
about the safety of their child at school.
  Mr. Chair, it is time to re-welcome parents back into education. It 
is time for parents to have the right to know what is going on in 
American education today. That is why I--and I encourage everybody--to 
support H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, critical legislation 
that empowers parents and prioritizes the needs of students over 
entrenched special interest groups.
  Today, this body has an extraordinary opportunity to reclaim the 
moral high ground in America and usher in a newer era of K-12 education 
that empowers parents, protects kids, and expands educational freedom.
  American parents have said they want to be a part of their children's 
education. It is time for this body to say ``yes'' and support parents.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the ranking member of the Early 
Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction of the bill.
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 
5, which should be called the politics over parents act.
  After spending 15 years as a very involved public school parent, I 
can say without hesitation that I strongly support parental involvement 
in education. You won't meet a Member on this side of the aisle that 
disagrees with that. The bill before us today misses the mark.
  This could have been an opportunity to address the real challenges 
facing education, to make changes that would involve parents in a 
constructive way, and also make a positive difference in education. I 
am disappointed that we aren't doing that.
  House Democrats have shown time and time again that we are committed 
to providing all parents--including those who traditionally face 
barriers to engagement--with meaningful involvement in their kids' 
schools. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Democratic 
Party is the party of parental rights and family values.
  We have put forward a substantive plan that will actually increase 
the frequency, quality, and accessibility of parental involvement and 
engagement in schools; a substantive plan that invests in evidence-
based models and support systems that have been shown to increase 
family engagement and improve student achievement; a substantive plan 
that encourages parents to be partners, not adversaries, in their 
children's education; a substantive plan that roots out discrimination 
based on race, disability, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or 
gender identity in our public schools; a substantive plan that, unlike 
H.R. 5, doesn't carry dangerous, authoritarian undertones encouraging 
book bans, discouraging the teaching of scientifically and historically 
accurate curricula, and leading to the micromanagement of the work of 
educators.

  We welcome a conversation about how to empower parents, and urge our 
friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle to abandon their 
politically motivated attacks on schoolteachers and students. We should 
instead be working together on these issues in a bipartisan manner. Our 
Nation's students and families deserve that.
  We need more parents, including those from diverse backgrounds, to 
feel included, supported, engaged, and welcomed at their kids' school. 
This bill does not even begin to do that.
  I am leading more than 45 of our colleagues on a Bill of Rights for 
Students and Parents, a resolution that is supported by more than 250 
education, civil rights, and parents' groups, including the National 
PTA.
  I have heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that 
history will judge us on how we respond to the needs of students and 
families at this moment, and I agree with them.
  Will we succumb to an extremist, discriminatory, narrow-minded, anti-
public-education agenda, or will we work together to advance 
commonsense, meaningful policies that will support parents, students, 
and educators?
  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to take the approach that 
still sees public education as the great equalizer for all students 
regardless of who they are or where they are from, essential to our 
communities, the economy, and our democratic Republic.
  Please join me in rejecting this bill.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a statement from the National PTA 
in opposition to H.R. 5.


[[Page H1350]]


       Dear Representative Bobby Scott: National PTA and our 
     network of millions of parents and educators across the 
     country urge you to support adoption of the Bonamici 
     Substitute Amendment and oppose the underlying legislation, 
     H.R. 5, on the House Floor tomorrow.
       PTA opposes the underlying bill, H.R. 5, because it has the 
     potential to cause significant harm to children and families. 
     If passed as written, H.R. 5 could:
       Prevent mental health support for students in need;
       Limit access to learning-enhancing technology and 
     educational materials;
       Lead to inappropriate and harmful book bans and curriculum 
     censorship;
       Create confusion for school staff and burdensome opt-in 
     requirements for families;
       Impair relationships between educators and parents; and
       Undermine efforts to create safe, welcoming, supportive, 
     and inclusive learning environments for all students and 
     families.
       PTA supports Representative Bonamici's Substitute Amendment 
     to H.R. 5 as the ONLY PATH forward to ensuring supports and 
     services are in place for true family-school partnerships. We 
     stand behind our National Standards for Family-School 
     Partnerships that have been in place for over 20 years. The 
     Substitute Amendment provides the opportunity for meaningful 
     and inclusive family engagement in K-12 education and if 
     adopted would replace the current H.R. 5 and enable our 
     Nation's public schools to:
       Create a parent coordinator position in public schools;
       Reinforce existing parents' rights under federal law;
       Prohibit the federal government from curriculum censorship 
     and banning books; and
       Invest in full-service community schools and Statewide 
     Family Engagement Centers Program (the new authorization 
     level of $60 million would allow all states to participate).
       As the Nation's oldest and largest child advocacy 
     association, we know what meaningful family engagement looks 
     like and what parents want from their policymakers. We ask 
     you to join us in supporting the Bonamici Substitute 
     Amendment and opposing the underlying bill, H.R. 5 on the 
     House Floor. We thank you for consideration of this request 
     and if you have any questions, please reach out to our 
     Director of Government Affairs, Kate Clabaugh.

  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman's time has expired. The gentlewoman is no 
longer recognized.


                         Parliamentary Inquiry

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Was the gentlewoman's request to introduce a 
statement recognized?
  The CHAIR. That request is covered under general leave.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the chair of the Agriculture Committee.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong 
support of the Parents Bill of Rights Act. This legislation is just one 
of many promises we intend to keep in our ``Commitment to America.''
  As a recovering school board member, I know firsthand the importance 
of hearing from parents and encouraging them to be engaged in their 
child's education.
  The Parents Bill of Rights Act provides parents an expanded 
opportunity to engage with their children and the teachers who educate 
them. This bill implements clear, commonsense protections allowing 
parents to easily review curriculum information, academic standards, 
and see how schools are spending our tax dollars.
  Parents deserve the right to be heard and should be able to raise 
concerns and address their school board without fear of harassment or 
retribution.
  This bill includes simple protections to keep our children safe, from 
protecting their privacy to requiring parents to be notified of violent 
activity in the school.
  As a graduate of the public school system and having raised three 
sons in the very same school district, I know parental involvement is 
critical to fostering a successful educational environment.
  Mr. Chair, quite simply, this bill is common sense. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation that ensures parents are at the 
center of their child's educational experience.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the 
Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
politics over parents act as a member of the Education and the 
Workforce Committee, as a member of the LGBTQ community, but above all, 
as a teacher.
  I am an educator and I know how important parental involvement is. 
All parents, including the parents of LGBTQ kids, have rights. They 
have rights to send their children to schools where they will be 
affirmed, protected, and free from harassment, and given the 
opportunity to thrive. They have a right to be free from bullying and 
humiliation.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from a million 
MomsRising.

                            [Mar. 21, 2023]

  So-Called `Parents Bill of Rights' Is All Wrong for America's Moms, 
 Families--A Toxic Plan That Will Create More Division, Damage to Our 
                          Kids and Communities

       Statement of Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, Executive Director 
     and CEO of MomsRising, the online and on-the-ground 
     organization of more than one million mothers and their 
     families, on the so-called `Parents Bill of Rights' (H.R. 5) 
     House Republicans are poised to pass this week:
       ``The badly misnamed `Parents Bill of Rights' the House GOP 
     plans to vote on this week is all wrong for America's moms, 
     kids, families, and educators. It is a recipe for censorship, 
     bullying and book bans, and for division based on race, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, masquerading as a 
     bill of rights. If it were to become law, the Parents Bill of 
     Rights would create more division by pitting educators 
     against parents. It would do enormous damage to our kids, 
     schools and communities.
       ``America's moms want schools to be safe and inclusive and 
     to value diversity; for parents to be respectful; and for 
     educators to be able to be honest about their identities and 
     allowed to teach our country's truths, good and bad, and the 
     values that got us to where we are today. We want our 
     children to learn about the history and obstacles faced, and 
     overcome, by members of our Black, Brown, AAPI, Native 
     American, immigrant, religious-minority, LGBTQ+, and other 
     communities. We want our students to be able to access 
     unbiased health information. We want all our youth, 
     regardless of income, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, to be safe and 
     included in schools that prepare them to contribute to and 
     succeed in our society.
       ``And we want a society that rejects `us vs. them' and puts 
     in place the caregiving and other supports that will allow 
     all families to succeed. MomsRising has more than a million 
     members and we have been working closely with moms in every 
     state for more than a decade. What this country's moms want 
     from Congress is affordable child, elder and disability care; 
     paid family and medical leave; fair pay; health care and 
     medications we can afford; vastly improved maternal health 
     care for all of us; the ability to make our own decisions 
     about if, when and how many children to have; and laws that 
     will end the scourge of gun violence and keep our children, 
     streets, schools and communities safe.
       ``Coming soon, we will release the Moms Rising for Freedom 
     Agenda with ten key policies lawmakers should support that 
     moms across the Nation really want, instead of the divisive 
     and harmful policies in the `Parents Bill of Rights.' That is 
     how we build a society in which we can all flourish and 
     thrive.''
  Mr. TAKANO. In committee, my Republican colleagues have preached 
about parents' God-given rights. I will tell you now that children have 
a God-given right not to be physically or emotionally harmed.
  As a teacher, I know of instances where children were outed by staff, 
and as a consequence those children faced severe punishment at home. 
One student was viciously beaten by his father and transferred out of a 
district after his family was informed that he was caught being 
physically affectionate with another boy.
  Imagine the situation in which educators are placed when government 
requires them to out their student to an unsupportive family. I will 
tell you what happens to those kids:
  73 percent of LGBTQ youth report anxiety.
  58 percent of them report depression.
  40 percent of homeless youth are LGBTQ, and
  46 percent, nearly half of them, have seriously considered suicide.
  Good teachers care about their kids. Good teachers know that a 
relationship with parents is important. But when a home is not safe for 
LGBTQ kids, school becomes their safe place, and teachers need to be 
their cheerleaders, not their first bullies.
  This bill forces good teachers to do bad things. It alienates 
students from their parents. It outs kids. It forces kids back into the 
closet. It is a fundamental invasion of privacy that puts children in 
danger.
  In the first 3 months that this Congress has been in session, this is 
what

[[Page H1351]]

Republicans have chosen to spend our time and taxpayer dollars on. The 
so-called Parents Bill of Rights Act is the exact type of Big 
Government overreach my colleagues across the aisle proclaim they are 
against, and puts the cost of their pursuit of political gain on the 
backs of students and teachers.
  This is worse than simply bad legislation. It is a concerted attack 
on children, parents, and teachers.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the bill.

                              {time}  1445

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the 
Parents Bill of Rights Act. I thank Representative Letlow and Chair 
Foxx for their leadership in defending the God-given rights of parents 
and protecting kids as well.
  Parental involvement in their children's education is paramount to a 
student's success. However, in recent years, we have seen a push by 
some to exclude parents from their children's education. This is why I 
recently introduced the PROTECT Kids Act with Senator Tim Scott which 
has been included as an amendment to H.R. 5.
  The PROTECT Kids Act would require any Department of Education-funded 
elementary or middle school to seek and acquire parental consent before 
changing their child's pronouns or preferred name on any school form.
  This provision is straightforward, common sense, and will safeguard 
the critical relationship between parents, schools, and children.
  When a child goes on a field trip or fails a test, their parents are 
told and are often required to sign an acknowledgment or a permission 
slip.
  Why should relatively small things require notification but something 
as significant as a child's pronouns or a change in accommodations can 
be withheld from the people who raise and love them?
  Recent polling shows this has the broad support of the American 
people. Three-quarters of Americans believe schools should be required 
to obtain consent from parents.
  Parents have a fundamental right to raise and educate their children 
how they choose. We must pass the Parents Bill of Rights Act to help 
mitigate issues we have seen nationwide and to support parents who need 
the support to do right by their kids as well.
  On this side of the aisle, we believe this is the right way to go, 
and we believe that in the end it will promote education, family, and 
individualism as well.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is a member of the 
Committee on Education and the Workforce.
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, Congress should be supporting parents, 
students, and teachers, not advancing this politics over parents act 
which would punish teachers for giving history lessons, ban books, and 
sow hate and divisiveness against trans kids.
  Parents have the utmost confidence in their kids' teachers. When it 
comes to writing curricula, 76 percent of parents trust their child's 
school. But when it comes to writing laws, political gimmicks, like 
this bill, keep them from saying the same thing about this very body.
  Instead of manufacturing outrage over curricula and books, why don't 
we just listen?
  Mr. Chairman, 84 percent of parents would rather Congress give free 
school meals, and 79 percent want support for mental health services. 
In a survey of parents' top concerns by The Pew Charitable Trusts, 40 
percent said they were extremely or very worried about their children 
struggling with depression, 35 percent said they were concerned about 
bullying, and 22 percent were worried about their kids being shot.
  Not a single one of those issues on the top list of parental concerns 
is addressed in this bill. So don't tell me this is a parents' bill of 
rights. This is not addressing gun violence. It is not addressing 
mental health. It is not addressing childcare, pre-K, and all of the 
other things that would be a part of a parents' bill of rights.
  Instead, we are spending time on a bill that sows doubt about public 
education and our teachers and also targets our very vulnerable trans 
kids who are absolutely no threat to anyone in this body.
  Please understand that the provisions in this bill that out trans 
kids are cruel and dangerous. I say that as a mom of a trans kid. I was 
very embracing to my daughter when she came out, but not every family 
is. The reality is that 75 percent of trans kids experience 
discrimination and harassment.
  So why do Republicans want schools to require outing LGBTQ students?
  That does not make them better students.
  Congress has the constitutional authority to write laws. What a 
mockery and betrayal of that duty it would be to pass this stunt of a 
bill that doesn't address a single priority of parents, bans books, 
undermines teachers, and hurts our kids.
  Democrats are the party of parents and families. We reject this bill, 
and we commit to fighting for childcare, for universal pre-K, for a 
child tax credit, and for the ability of people to be free for who they 
are and express themselves.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two letters. One is from the 
National Education Association, and one is from the American Federation 
of Teachers.

                               National Education Association,

                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.
     U.S. House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 3 million members of 
     the National Education Association, dedicated and trusted 
     professionals who teach and support nearly 50 million 
     students in public schools across America, we urge you to 
     vote NO on H.R. 5. Votes related to this bill, including 
     extreme amendments that would create a national private 
     school voucher program, may be included in the NEA Report 
     Card for the 118th Congress.
       H.R. 5 is unnecessary and ignores the partnerships that 
     exist between parents and educators. Parents and guardians 
     already have the right and the opportunity to partner with 
     educators to ensure students have the learning opportunities, 
     resources, and support for success. Across America, parents 
     are strategizing with educators when children face hurdles 
     and celebrating with them when students achieve milestones, 
     volunteering at events, chaperoning field trips, leading 
     PTAs,",

have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 5.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 241 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 5.
  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Flood) to preside 
over the Committee of the Whole.

                              {time}  1420


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 5) to ensure the rights of parents are honored and protected in 
the Nation's public schools, with Mr. Flood in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the 
first time.
  General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 2 
hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce or their 
respective designees.
  The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Scott) each will control 1 hour.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today to recognize the profound importance of H.R. 
5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and what it means for families 
across the country.
  Over the past several years, parents witnessed the consequences of 
lessons taught in classrooms firsthand. Math scores declined by the 
largest margin ever, and reading scores plummeted to the lowest levels 
in over three decades. These results are devastating.
  Teachers' unions and education bureaucrats worked to push progressive 
politics in classrooms while keeping parents in the dark. The Parents 
Bill of Rights Act aims to end that and shine a light on what is 
happening in schools. This bill will reaffirm a parent's right to 
review course curriculum, meet with the child's teacher, and be heard 
at school board meetings without fear of reprisal.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem convinced 
Republicans are using this bill to punish teachers or push an extreme 
rightwing agenda. This is false.
  Our education system is spiraling out of control as parents are 
pushed further outside the classroom. This bill will restore the role 
of parents in schools and provide new mechanisms to promote parent-
teacher partnerships.
  When parents are involved in their child's education, students 
thrive. That is the guiding principle of this bill. With the Parents 
Bill of Rights Act, Republicans will help parents steer the education 
of their children back onto the correct path where they can learn the 
skills they need for a lifetime of success.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the politics over parents 
act.
  First, let me be clear. House Democrats believe parental engagement 
is central to student success. Parental engagement in schools is 
closely linked to better student behavior, higher academic achievement, 
and enhanced social skills.
  Unfortunately, the politics over parents act does not take meaningful 
steps to increase or support parental engagement. In fact, it lists so-
called rights and then declares that this allows the parents to control 
what is taught. Let's be clear: There is nothing in the bill to give 
parents the right to dictate what their children are taught.
  Instead, this bill is one of many attempts by Republican politicians 
to give a vocal minority the power to try to impose their beliefs on 
all parents and students. This extreme education agenda has real 
consequences for students and educators.
  According to PEN America, over 2,500 books were banned in schools 
during the school year 2021-2022, and nearly 140 additional book bans 
have taken effect since July 2022.
  Let me just list some of the books that Republican politicians have 
gotten banned under the guise of parental rights: ``Diary of a Young 
Girl,'' the stories of a Holocaust survivor, by Anne Frank; ``The Kite 
Runner,'' a novel on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, by Khaled 
Hosseini; ``Beloved,'' a novel about slaves during the Civil War, by 
Toni Morrison; and on and on. Books like that have been banned because 
of efforts like what we have before us today.
  Let's be clear. These books are taught at age-appropriate levels. If 
you have a problem with it, you should call the librarian. Yet, 
Republican politicians are actually having them removed from classrooms 
and school libraries.
  Simply put, the politics over parents act is an educational gag order 
across the Nation which will prevent students from learning and prevent 
teachers from teaching. These efforts seek to score political points 
and scare parents into thinking that schools do not have their best 
interests at heart. Instead, we should be talking about the support 
that schools and families actually need to improve parent-teacher 
engagement.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the politics over 
parents act and join House Democrats in an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to deliver real solutions to build partnerships between 
schools and families.

  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Louisiana (Ms. Letlow).
  Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Chair, I rise today to join my voice with millions of 
American parents as the House considers H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of 
Rights Act.
  H.R. 5 is about one simple and fundamental principle: Parents should 
always have a seat at the table when it comes to their child's 
education.
  We believe that learning is a partnership between a family and their 
child's teachers. This bill is the vehicle by which we can put parents 
and educators together at the same table to have a productive dialogue.
  This bill is not complex or complicated, nor should it be partisan or 
polarizing. Contrary to what you may hear from my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, it is not an attack on our hardworking 
teachers, who will always be the heroes in my eyes. It is not an 
attempt to have Congress dictate the curriculum or determine the books 
in the library. Instead, this bill aims to bring more transparency and 
accountability to education, allowing parents to be informed and, when 
they have questions and concerns, to lawfully bring them to their local 
school boards.
  Over the past 2 years, we have seen too many instances where rather 
than opening their doors to welcome parents in as partners, some 
schools instead slammed them shut and said that government bureaucrats 
know what is best for our children.
  Parents across this country have overwhelmingly spoken out that they 
have had enough. They want a seat at the table because, at the end of 
the day, these are our children, not the government's.

[[Page H1349]]

  Mr. Chair, I worked in education before I came to Congress, and I am 
also a mom. I have seen firsthand how when you educate a child, you 
give them a future.
  We know that when parents are involved, it is the students who 
succeed. We also know that when a family is shut out of their child's 
education, it will lead to disastrous results.

                              {time}  1430

  Mr. Chair, let us give parents that voice in the learning process. 
Let schools open the doors and welcome them in as partners. Let us work 
together to build a brighter future for America's children.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), the ranking member on the Higher 
Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee.
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 
5. As an educator, I believe parent voices should be honored in 
schools. All educators believe this.
  We know that this bill is not about that at all. We have always had 
parents involved in our schools, so stop being foolish and divisive. We 
always need their input.
  This bill is nothing more than a talking point of the extreme MAGA 
agenda that will hurt children and hurt our schools. Let's face it--
there has been a movement to eliminate public education since the 1954 
Brown v. Board of Education decision.
  With the election of our President 7 years ago, it pulled the scab of 
a wound that never healed. Now it is an open, gaping wound, and it is 
out of control. They are throwing everything at public schools but the 
kitchen sink: vouchers, excessive testing, poorly paid teachers, 
banning books, and now they are trying to drive a wedge and create an 
antagonistic relationship between schools and their parents. How 
pathetic. How dreadful.
  Parents love teachers. Everybody loves teachers. Every parent has an 
``I love and remember a teacher'' story. How disgraceful that we want 
to terrorize the very people who love our children, keep them safe, and 
educate them for over 8 hours daily. Our teachers are sacrificial 
lambs.
  You will never eliminate public schools. We will fight you as long as 
it takes. This is all that the little children who look like me have. 
Public schools are the bedrock of this Nation.
  Let me tell you what a parent's bill of rights should include. I will 
call it the parents' 10 commandments:
  Thou shalt restore the Child Tax Credit; provide free, hot breakfast 
and lunch; provide free pre-K and free community college.
  Thou shalt end the school-to-prison pipeline; put a nurse in every 
school; offer after-school activities; provide intensive counseling 
services, particularly to address school shootings.
  Thou shalt offer parents the right to improve their education and job 
skills, love and respect every child's individuality, guarantee that 
every child's teacher will make a minimum of $60,000 a year.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Bean), chair of the Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary 
Education Subcommittee.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Chair, should parents have the right to be 
involved in their child's education?
  That is the question before us. Seventy-two percent of Americans have 
answered ``yes'' to that question. Parents should be and want to be 
involved in their child's education.
  According to numerous studies, students who have involved parents 
have better behavior, better grades, better attendance, and develop a 
lifelong love of learning, which is the key to long-term success.
  Today, American parents are fed up, largely because they have 
experienced 2 years of school closures, misguided COVID policies, 
disastrous remote learning, and a curriculum focused on what is woke 
rather than what is essential academic instruction. They have been 
branded ``domestic terrorists'' for speaking out at school boards. Some 
were even arrested for having the nerve to plead with school boards 
about the safety of their child at school.
  Mr. Chair, it is time to re-welcome parents back into education. It 
is time for parents to have the right to know what is going on in 
American education today. That is why I--and I encourage everybody--to 
support H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, critical legislation 
that empowers parents and prioritizes the needs of students over 
entrenched special interest groups.
  Today, this body has an extraordinary opportunity to reclaim the 
moral high ground in America and usher in a newer era of K-12 education 
that empowers parents, protects kids, and expands educational freedom.
  American parents have said they want to be a part of their children's 
education. It is time for this body to say ``yes'' and support parents.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the ranking member of the Early 
Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction of the bill.
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 
5, which should be called the politics over parents act.
  After spending 15 years as a very involved public school parent, I 
can say without hesitation that I strongly support parental involvement 
in education. You won't meet a Member on this side of the aisle that 
disagrees with that. The bill before us today misses the mark.
  This could have been an opportunity to address the real challenges 
facing education, to make changes that would involve parents in a 
constructive way, and also make a positive difference in education. I 
am disappointed that we aren't doing that.
  House Democrats have shown time and time again that we are committed 
to providing all parents--including those who traditionally face 
barriers to engagement--with meaningful involvement in their kids' 
schools. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Democratic 
Party is the party of parental rights and family values.
  We have put forward a substantive plan that will actually increase 
the frequency, quality, and accessibility of parental involvement and 
engagement in schools; a substantive plan that invests in evidence-
based models and support systems that have been shown to increase 
family engagement and improve student achievement; a substantive plan 
that encourages parents to be partners, not adversaries, in their 
children's education; a substantive plan that roots out discrimination 
based on race, disability, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or 
gender identity in our public schools; a substantive plan that, unlike 
H.R. 5, doesn't carry dangerous, authoritarian undertones encouraging 
book bans, discouraging the teaching of scientifically and historically 
accurate curricula, and leading to the micromanagement of the work of 
educators.

  We welcome a conversation about how to empower parents, and urge our 
friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle to abandon their 
politically motivated attacks on schoolteachers and students. We should 
instead be working together on these issues in a bipartisan manner. Our 
Nation's students and families deserve that.
  We need more parents, including those from diverse backgrounds, to 
feel included, supported, engaged, and welcomed at their kids' school. 
This bill does not even begin to do that.
  I am leading more than 45 of our colleagues on a Bill of Rights for 
Students and Parents, a resolution that is supported by more than 250 
education, civil rights, and parents' groups, including the National 
PTA.
  I have heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that 
history will judge us on how we respond to the needs of students and 
families at this moment, and I agree with them.
  Will we succumb to an extremist, discriminatory, narrow-minded, anti-
public-education agenda, or will we work together to advance 
commonsense, meaningful policies that will support parents, students, 
and educators?
  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to take the approach that 
still sees public education as the great equalizer for all students 
regardless of who they are or where they are from, essential to our 
communities, the economy, and our democratic Republic.
  Please join me in rejecting this bill.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a statement from the National PTA 
in opposition to H.R. 5.


[[Page H1350]]


       Dear Representative Bobby Scott: National PTA and our 
     network of millions of parents and educators across the 
     country urge you to support adoption of the Bonamici 
     Substitute Amendment and oppose the underlying legislation, 
     H.R. 5, on the House Floor tomorrow.
       PTA opposes the underlying bill, H.R. 5, because it has the 
     potential to cause significant harm to children and families. 
     If passed as written, H.R. 5 could:
       Prevent mental health support for students in need;
       Limit access to learning-enhancing technology and 
     educational materials;
       Lead to inappropriate and harmful book bans and curriculum 
     censorship;
       Create confusion for school staff and burdensome opt-in 
     requirements for families;
       Impair relationships between educators and parents; and
       Undermine efforts to create safe, welcoming, supportive, 
     and inclusive learning environments for all students and 
     families.
       PTA supports Representative Bonamici's Substitute Amendment 
     to H.R. 5 as the ONLY PATH forward to ensuring supports and 
     services are in place for true family-school partnerships. We 
     stand behind our National Standards for Family-School 
     Partnerships that have been in place for over 20 years. The 
     Substitute Amendment provides the opportunity for meaningful 
     and inclusive family engagement in K-12 education and if 
     adopted would replace the current H.R. 5 and enable our 
     Nation's public schools to:
       Create a parent coordinator position in public schools;
       Reinforce existing parents' rights under federal law;
       Prohibit the federal government from curriculum censorship 
     and banning books; and
       Invest in full-service community schools and Statewide 
     Family Engagement Centers Program (the new authorization 
     level of $60 million would allow all states to participate).
       As the Nation's oldest and largest child advocacy 
     association, we know what meaningful family engagement looks 
     like and what parents want from their policymakers. We ask 
     you to join us in supporting the Bonamici Substitute 
     Amendment and opposing the underlying bill, H.R. 5 on the 
     House Floor. We thank you for consideration of this request 
     and if you have any questions, please reach out to our 
     Director of Government Affairs, Kate Clabaugh.

  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman's time has expired. The gentlewoman is no 
longer recognized.


                         Parliamentary Inquiry

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Was the gentlewoman's request to introduce a 
statement recognized?
  The CHAIR. That request is covered under general leave.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the chair of the Agriculture Committee.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong 
support of the Parents Bill of Rights Act. This legislation is just one 
of many promises we intend to keep in our ``Commitment to America.''
  As a recovering school board member, I know firsthand the importance 
of hearing from parents and encouraging them to be engaged in their 
child's education.
  The Parents Bill of Rights Act provides parents an expanded 
opportunity to engage with their children and the teachers who educate 
them. This bill implements clear, commonsense protections allowing 
parents to easily review curriculum information, academic standards, 
and see how schools are spending our tax dollars.
  Parents deserve the right to be heard and should be able to raise 
concerns and address their school board without fear of harassment or 
retribution.
  This bill includes simple protections to keep our children safe, from 
protecting their privacy to requiring parents to be notified of violent 
activity in the school.
  As a graduate of the public school system and having raised three 
sons in the very same school district, I know parental involvement is 
critical to fostering a successful educational environment.
  Mr. Chair, quite simply, this bill is common sense. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation that ensures parents are at the 
center of their child's educational experience.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the 
Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
politics over parents act as a member of the Education and the 
Workforce Committee, as a member of the LGBTQ community, but above all, 
as a teacher.
  I am an educator and I know how important parental involvement is. 
All parents, including the parents of LGBTQ kids, have rights. They 
have rights to send their children to schools where they will be 
affirmed, protected, and free from harassment, and given the 
opportunity to thrive. They have a right to be free from bullying and 
humiliation.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from a million 
MomsRising.

                            [Mar. 21, 2023]

  So-Called `Parents Bill of Rights' Is All Wrong for America's Moms, 
 Families--A Toxic Plan That Will Create More Division, Damage to Our 
                          Kids and Communities

       Statement of Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, Executive Director 
     and CEO of MomsRising, the online and on-the-ground 
     organization of more than one million mothers and their 
     families, on the so-called `Parents Bill of Rights' (H.R. 5) 
     House Republicans are poised to pass this week:
       ``The badly misnamed `Parents Bill of Rights' the House GOP 
     plans to vote on this week is all wrong for America's moms, 
     kids, families, and educators. It is a recipe for censorship, 
     bullying and book bans, and for division based on race, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, masquerading as a 
     bill of rights. If it were to become law, the Parents Bill of 
     Rights would create more division by pitting educators 
     against parents. It would do enormous damage to our kids, 
     schools and communities.
       ``America's moms want schools to be safe and inclusive and 
     to value diversity; for parents to be respectful; and for 
     educators to be able to be honest about their identities and 
     allowed to teach our country's truths, good and bad, and the 
     values that got us to where we are today. We want our 
     children to learn about the history and obstacles faced, and 
     overcome, by members of our Black, Brown, AAPI, Native 
     American, immigrant, religious-minority, LGBTQ+, and other 
     communities. We want our students to be able to access 
     unbiased health information. We want all our youth, 
     regardless of income, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, to be safe and 
     included in schools that prepare them to contribute to and 
     succeed in our society.
       ``And we want a society that rejects `us vs. them' and puts 
     in place the caregiving and other supports that will allow 
     all families to succeed. MomsRising has more than a million 
     members and we have been working closely with moms in every 
     state for more than a decade. What this country's moms want 
     from Congress is affordable child, elder and disability care; 
     paid family and medical leave; fair pay; health care and 
     medications we can afford; vastly improved maternal health 
     care for all of us; the ability to make our own decisions 
     about if, when and how many children to have; and laws that 
     will end the scourge of gun violence and keep our children, 
     streets, schools and communities safe.
       ``Coming soon, we will release the Moms Rising for Freedom 
     Agenda with ten key policies lawmakers should support that 
     moms across the Nation really want, instead of the divisive 
     and harmful policies in the `Parents Bill of Rights.' That is 
     how we build a society in which we can all flourish and 
     thrive.''
  Mr. TAKANO. In committee, my Republican colleagues have preached 
about parents' God-given rights. I will tell you now that children have 
a God-given right not to be physically or emotionally harmed.
  As a teacher, I know of instances where children were outed by staff, 
and as a consequence those children faced severe punishment at home. 
One student was viciously beaten by his father and transferred out of a 
district after his family was informed that he was caught being 
physically affectionate with another boy.
  Imagine the situation in which educators are placed when government 
requires them to out their student to an unsupportive family. I will 
tell you what happens to those kids:
  73 percent of LGBTQ youth report anxiety.
  58 percent of them report depression.
  40 percent of homeless youth are LGBTQ, and
  46 percent, nearly half of them, have seriously considered suicide.
  Good teachers care about their kids. Good teachers know that a 
relationship with parents is important. But when a home is not safe for 
LGBTQ kids, school becomes their safe place, and teachers need to be 
their cheerleaders, not their first bullies.
  This bill forces good teachers to do bad things. It alienates 
students from their parents. It outs kids. It forces kids back into the 
closet. It is a fundamental invasion of privacy that puts children in 
danger.
  In the first 3 months that this Congress has been in session, this is 
what

[[Page H1351]]

Republicans have chosen to spend our time and taxpayer dollars on. The 
so-called Parents Bill of Rights Act is the exact type of Big 
Government overreach my colleagues across the aisle proclaim they are 
against, and puts the cost of their pursuit of political gain on the 
backs of students and teachers.
  This is worse than simply bad legislation. It is a concerted attack 
on children, parents, and teachers.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the bill.

                              {time}  1445

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the 
Parents Bill of Rights Act. I thank Representative Letlow and Chair 
Foxx for their leadership in defending the God-given rights of parents 
and protecting kids as well.
  Parental involvement in their children's education is paramount to a 
student's success. However, in recent years, we have seen a push by 
some to exclude parents from their children's education. This is why I 
recently introduced the PROTECT Kids Act with Senator Tim Scott which 
has been included as an amendment to H.R. 5.
  The PROTECT Kids Act would require any Department of Education-funded 
elementary or middle school to seek and acquire parental consent before 
changing their child's pronouns or preferred name on any school form.
  This provision is straightforward, common sense, and will safeguard 
the critical relationship between parents, schools, and children.
  When a child goes on a field trip or fails a test, their parents are 
told and are often required to sign an acknowledgment or a permission 
slip.
  Why should relatively small things require notification but something 
as significant as a child's pronouns or a change in accommodations can 
be withheld from the people who raise and love them?
  Recent polling shows this has the broad support of the American 
people. Three-quarters of Americans believe schools should be required 
to obtain consent from parents.
  Parents have a fundamental right to raise and educate their children 
how they choose. We must pass the Parents Bill of Rights Act to help 
mitigate issues we have seen nationwide and to support parents who need 
the support to do right by their kids as well.
  On this side of the aisle, we believe this is the right way to go, 
and we believe that in the end it will promote education, family, and 
individualism as well.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is a member of the 
Committee on Education and the Workforce.
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, Congress should be supporting parents, 
students, and teachers, not advancing this politics over parents act 
which would punish teachers for giving history lessons, ban books, and 
sow hate and divisiveness against trans kids.
  Parents have the utmost confidence in their kids' teachers. When it 
comes to writing curricula, 76 percent of parents trust their child's 
school. But when it comes to writing laws, political gimmicks, like 
this bill, keep them from saying the same thing about this very body.
  Instead of manufacturing outrage over curricula and books, why don't 
we just listen?
  Mr. Chairman, 84 percent of parents would rather Congress give free 
school meals, and 79 percent want support for mental health services. 
In a survey of parents' top concerns by The Pew Charitable Trusts, 40 
percent said they were extremely or very worried about their children 
struggling with depression, 35 percent said they were concerned about 
bullying, and 22 percent were worried about their kids being shot.
  Not a single one of those issues on the top list of parental concerns 
is addressed in this bill. So don't tell me this is a parents' bill of 
rights. This is not addressing gun violence. It is not addressing 
mental health. It is not addressing childcare, pre-K, and all of the 
other things that would be a part of a parents' bill of rights.
  Instead, we are spending time on a bill that sows doubt about public 
education and our teachers and also targets our very vulnerable trans 
kids who are absolutely no threat to anyone in this body.
  Please understand that the provisions in this bill that out trans 
kids are cruel and dangerous. I say that as a mom of a trans kid. I was 
very embracing to my daughter when she came out, but not every family 
is. The reality is that 75 percent of trans kids experience 
discrimination and harassment.
  So why do Republicans want schools to require outing LGBTQ students?
  That does not make them better students.
  Congress has the constitutional authority to write laws. What a 
mockery and betrayal of that duty it would be to pass this stunt of a 
bill that doesn't address a single priority of parents, bans books, 
undermines teachers, and hurts our kids.
  Democrats are the party of parents and families. We reject this bill, 
and we commit to fighting for childcare, for universal pre-K, for a 
child tax credit, and for the ability of people to be free for who they 
are and express themselves.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two letters. One is from the 
National Education Association, and one is from the American Federation 
of Teachers.

                               National Education Association,

                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.
     U.S. House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 3 million members of 
     the National Education Association, dedicated and trusted 
     professionals who teach and support nearly 50 million 
     students in public schools across America, we urge you to 
     vote NO on H.R. 5. Votes related to this bill, including 
     extreme amendments that would create a national private 
     school voucher program, may be included in the NEA Report 
     Card for the 118th Congress.
       H.R. 5 is unnecessary and ignores the partnerships that 
     exist between parents and educators. Parents and guardians 
     already have the right and the opportunity to partner with 
     educators to ensure students have the learning opportunities, 
     resources, and support for success. Across America, parents 
     are strategizing with educators when children face hurdles 
     and celebrating with them when students achieve milestones, 
     volunteering at events, chaperoning field trips, leading 
     PTAs,",

  The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Scott) each will control 1 hour.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today to recognize the profound importance of H.R. 
5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and what it means for families 
across the country.
  Over the past several years, parents witnessed the consequences of 
lessons taught in classrooms firsthand. Math scores declined by the 
largest margin ever, and reading scores plummeted to the lowest levels 
in over three decades. These results are devastating.
  Teachers' unions and education bureaucrats worked to push progressive 
politics in classrooms while keeping parents in the dark. The Parents 
Bill of Rights Act aims to end that and shine a light on what is 
happening in schools. This bill will reaffirm a parent's right to 
review course curriculum, meet with the child's teacher, and be heard 
at school board meetings without fear of reprisal.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem convinced 
Republicans are using this bill to punish teachers or push an extreme 
rightwing agenda. This is false.
  Our education system is spiraling out of control as parents are 
pushed further outside the classroom. This bill will restore the role 
of parents in schools and provide new mechanisms to promote parent-
teacher partnerships.
  When parents are involved in their child's education, students 
thrive. That is the guiding principle of this bill. With the Parents 
Bill of Rights Act, Republicans will help parents steer the education 
of their children back onto the correct path where they can learn the 
skills they need for a lifetime of success.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the politics over parents 
act.
  First, let me be clear. House Democrats believe parental engagement 
is central to student success. Parental engagement in schools is 
closely linked to better student behavior, higher academic achievement, 
and enhanced social skills.
  Unfortunately, the politics over parents act does not take meaningful 
steps to increase or support parental engagement. In fact, it lists so-
called rights and then declares that this allows the parents to control 
what is taught. Let's be clear: There is nothing in the bill to give 
parents the right to dictate what their children are taught.
  Instead, this bill is one of many attempts by Republican politicians 
to give a vocal minority the power to try to impose their beliefs on 
all parents and students. This extreme education agenda has real 
consequences for students and educators.
  According to PEN America, over 2,500 books were banned in schools 
during the school year 2021-2022, and nearly 140 additional book bans 
have taken effect since July 2022.
  Let me just list some of the books that Republican politicians have 
gotten banned under the guise of parental rights: ``Diary of a Young 
Girl,'' the stories of a Holocaust survivor, by Anne Frank; ``The Kite 
Runner,'' a novel on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, by Khaled 
Hosseini; ``Beloved,'' a novel about slaves during the Civil War, by 
Toni Morrison; and on and on. Books like that have been banned because 
of efforts like what we have before us today.
  Let's be clear. These books are taught at age-appropriate levels. If 
you have a problem with it, you should call the librarian. Yet, 
Republican politicians are actually having them removed from classrooms 
and school libraries.
  Simply put, the politics over parents act is an educational gag order 
across the Nation which will prevent students from learning and prevent 
teachers from teaching. These efforts seek to score political points 
and scare parents into thinking that schools do not have their best 
interests at heart. Instead, we should be talking about the support 
that schools and families actually need to improve parent-teacher 
engagement.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the politics over 
parents act and join House Democrats in an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to deliver real solutions to build partnerships between 
schools and families.

  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Louisiana (Ms. Letlow).
  Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Chair, I rise today to join my voice with millions of 
American parents as the House considers H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of 
Rights Act.
  H.R. 5 is about one simple and fundamental principle: Parents should 
always have a seat at the table when it comes to their child's 
education.
  We believe that learning is a partnership between a family and their 
child's teachers. This bill is the vehicle by which we can put parents 
and educators together at the same table to have a productive dialogue.
  This bill is not complex or complicated, nor should it be partisan or 
polarizing. Contrary to what you may hear from my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, it is not an attack on our hardworking 
teachers, who will always be the heroes in my eyes. It is not an 
attempt to have Congress dictate the curriculum or determine the books 
in the library. Instead, this bill aims to bring more transparency and 
accountability to education, allowing parents to be informed and, when 
they have questions and concerns, to lawfully bring them to their local 
school boards.
  Over the past 2 years, we have seen too many instances where rather 
than opening their doors to welcome parents in as partners, some 
schools instead slammed them shut and said that government bureaucrats 
know what is best for our children.
  Parents across this country have overwhelmingly spoken out that they 
have had enough. They want a seat at the table because, at the end of 
the day, these are our children, not the government's.

[[Page H1349]]

  Mr. Chair, I worked in education before I came to Congress, and I am 
also a mom. I have seen firsthand how when you educate a child, you 
give them a future.
  We know that when parents are involved, it is the students who 
succeed. We also know that when a family is shut out of their child's 
education, it will lead to disastrous results.

                              {time}  1430

  Mr. Chair, let us give parents that voice in the learning process. 
Let schools open the doors and welcome them in as partners. Let us work 
together to build a brighter future for America's children.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), the ranking member on the Higher 
Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee.
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 
5. As an educator, I believe parent voices should be honored in 
schools. All educators believe this.
  We know that this bill is not about that at all. We have always had 
parents involved in our schools, so stop being foolish and divisive. We 
always need their input.
  This bill is nothing more than a talking point of the extreme MAGA 
agenda that will hurt children and hurt our schools. Let's face it--
there has been a movement to eliminate public education since the 1954 
Brown v. Board of Education decision.
  With the election of our President 7 years ago, it pulled the scab of 
a wound that never healed. Now it is an open, gaping wound, and it is 
out of control. They are throwing everything at public schools but the 
kitchen sink: vouchers, excessive testing, poorly paid teachers, 
banning books, and now they are trying to drive a wedge and create an 
antagonistic relationship between schools and their parents. How 
pathetic. How dreadful.
  Parents love teachers. Everybody loves teachers. Every parent has an 
``I love and remember a teacher'' story. How disgraceful that we want 
to terrorize the very people who love our children, keep them safe, and 
educate them for over 8 hours daily. Our teachers are sacrificial 
lambs.
  You will never eliminate public schools. We will fight you as long as 
it takes. This is all that the little children who look like me have. 
Public schools are the bedrock of this Nation.
  Let me tell you what a parent's bill of rights should include. I will 
call it the parents' 10 commandments:
  Thou shalt restore the Child Tax Credit; provide free, hot breakfast 
and lunch; provide free pre-K and free community college.
  Thou shalt end the school-to-prison pipeline; put a nurse in every 
school; offer after-school activities; provide intensive counseling 
services, particularly to address school shootings.
  Thou shalt offer parents the right to improve their education and job 
skills, love and respect every child's individuality, guarantee that 
every child's teacher will make a minimum of $60,000 a year.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Bean), chair of the Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary 
Education Subcommittee.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Chair, should parents have the right to be 
involved in their child's education?
  That is the question before us. Seventy-two percent of Americans have 
answered ``yes'' to that question. Parents should be and want to be 
involved in their child's education.
  According to numerous studies, students who have involved parents 
have better behavior, better grades, better attendance, and develop a 
lifelong love of learning, which is the key to long-term success.
  Today, American parents are fed up, largely because they have 
experienced 2 years of school closures, misguided COVID policies, 
disastrous remote learning, and a curriculum focused on what is woke 
rather than what is essential academic instruction. They have been 
branded ``domestic terrorists'' for speaking out at school boards. Some 
were even arrested for having the nerve to plead with school boards 
about the safety of their child at school.
  Mr. Chair, it is time to re-welcome parents back into education. It 
is time for parents to have the right to know what is going on in 
American education today. That is why I--and I encourage everybody--to 
support H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, critical legislation 
that empowers parents and prioritizes the needs of students over 
entrenched special interest groups.
  Today, this body has an extraordinary opportunity to reclaim the 
moral high ground in America and usher in a newer era of K-12 education 
that empowers parents, protects kids, and expands educational freedom.
  American parents have said they want to be a part of their children's 
education. It is time for this body to say ``yes'' and support parents.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the ranking member of the Early 
Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction of the bill.
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 
5, which should be called the politics over parents act.
  After spending 15 years as a very involved public school parent, I 
can say without hesitation that I strongly support parental involvement 
in education. You won't meet a Member on this side of the aisle that 
disagrees with that. The bill before us today misses the mark.
  This could have been an opportunity to address the real challenges 
facing education, to make changes that would involve parents in a 
constructive way, and also make a positive difference in education. I 
am disappointed that we aren't doing that.
  House Democrats have shown time and time again that we are committed 
to providing all parents--including those who traditionally face 
barriers to engagement--with meaningful involvement in their kids' 
schools. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Democratic 
Party is the party of parental rights and family values.
  We have put forward a substantive plan that will actually increase 
the frequency, quality, and accessibility of parental involvement and 
engagement in schools; a substantive plan that invests in evidence-
based models and support systems that have been shown to increase 
family engagement and improve student achievement; a substantive plan 
that encourages parents to be partners, not adversaries, in their 
children's education; a substantive plan that roots out discrimination 
based on race, disability, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or 
gender identity in our public schools; a substantive plan that, unlike 
H.R. 5, doesn't carry dangerous, authoritarian undertones encouraging 
book bans, discouraging the teaching of scientifically and historically 
accurate curricula, and leading to the micromanagement of the work of 
educators.

  We welcome a conversation about how to empower parents, and urge our 
friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle to abandon their 
politically motivated attacks on schoolteachers and students. We should 
instead be working together on these issues in a bipartisan manner. Our 
Nation's students and families deserve that.
  We need more parents, including those from diverse backgrounds, to 
feel included, supported, engaged, and welcomed at their kids' school. 
This bill does not even begin to do that.
  I am leading more than 45 of our colleagues on a Bill of Rights for 
Students and Parents, a resolution that is supported by more than 250 
education, civil rights, and parents' groups, including the National 
PTA.
  I have heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that 
history will judge us on how we respond to the needs of students and 
families at this moment, and I agree with them.
  Will we succumb to an extremist, discriminatory, narrow-minded, anti-
public-education agenda, or will we work together to advance 
commonsense, meaningful policies that will support parents, students, 
and educators?
  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to take the approach that 
still sees public education as the great equalizer for all students 
regardless of who they are or where they are from, essential to our 
communities, the economy, and our democratic Republic.
  Please join me in rejecting this bill.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a statement from the National PTA 
in opposition to H.R. 5.


[[Page H1350]]


       Dear Representative Bobby Scott: National PTA and our 
     network of millions of parents and educators across the 
     country urge you to support adoption of the Bonamici 
     Substitute Amendment and oppose the underlying legislation, 
     H.R. 5, on the House Floor tomorrow.
       PTA opposes the underlying bill, H.R. 5, because it has the 
     potential to cause significant harm to children and families. 
     If passed as written, H.R. 5 could:
       Prevent mental health support for students in need;
       Limit access to learning-enhancing technology and 
     educational materials;
       Lead to inappropriate and harmful book bans and curriculum 
     censorship;
       Create confusion for school staff and burdensome opt-in 
     requirements for families;
       Impair relationships between educators and parents; and
       Undermine efforts to create safe, welcoming, supportive, 
     and inclusive learning environments for all students and 
     families.
       PTA supports Representative Bonamici's Substitute Amendment 
     to H.R. 5 as the ONLY PATH forward to ensuring supports and 
     services are in place for true family-school partnerships. We 
     stand behind our National Standards for Family-School 
     Partnerships that have been in place for over 20 years. The 
     Substitute Amendment provides the opportunity for meaningful 
     and inclusive family engagement in K-12 education and if 
     adopted would replace the current H.R. 5 and enable our 
     Nation's public schools to:
       Create a parent coordinator position in public schools;
       Reinforce existing parents' rights under federal law;
       Prohibit the federal government from curriculum censorship 
     and banning books; and
       Invest in full-service community schools and Statewide 
     Family Engagement Centers Program (the new authorization 
     level of $60 million would allow all states to participate).
       As the Nation's oldest and largest child advocacy 
     association, we know what meaningful family engagement looks 
     like and what parents want from their policymakers. We ask 
     you to join us in supporting the Bonamici Substitute 
     Amendment and opposing the underlying bill, H.R. 5 on the 
     House Floor. We thank you for consideration of this request 
     and if you have any questions, please reach out to our 
     Director of Government Affairs, Kate Clabaugh.

  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman's time has expired. The gentlewoman is no 
longer recognized.


                         Parliamentary Inquiry

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Was the gentlewoman's request to introduce a 
statement recognized?
  The CHAIR. That request is covered under general leave.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the chair of the Agriculture Committee.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong 
support of the Parents Bill of Rights Act. This legislation is just one 
of many promises we intend to keep in our ``Commitment to America.''
  As a recovering school board member, I know firsthand the importance 
of hearing from parents and encouraging them to be engaged in their 
child's education.
  The Parents Bill of Rights Act provides parents an expanded 
opportunity to engage with their children and the teachers who educate 
them. This bill implements clear, commonsense protections allowing 
parents to easily review curriculum information, academic standards, 
and see how schools are spending our tax dollars.
  Parents deserve the right to be heard and should be able to raise 
concerns and address their school board without fear of harassment or 
retribution.
  This bill includes simple protections to keep our children safe, from 
protecting their privacy to requiring parents to be notified of violent 
activity in the school.
  As a graduate of the public school system and having raised three 
sons in the very same school district, I know parental involvement is 
critical to fostering a successful educational environment.
  Mr. Chair, quite simply, this bill is common sense. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation that ensures parents are at the 
center of their child's educational experience.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the 
Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
politics over parents act as a member of the Education and the 
Workforce Committee, as a member of the LGBTQ community, but above all, 
as a teacher.
  I am an educator and I know how important parental involvement is. 
All parents, including the parents of LGBTQ kids, have rights. They 
have rights to send their children to schools where they will be 
affirmed, protected, and free from harassment, and given the 
opportunity to thrive. They have a right to be free from bullying and 
humiliation.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from a million 
MomsRising.

                            [Mar. 21, 2023]

  So-Called `Parents Bill of Rights' Is All Wrong for America's Moms, 
 Families--A Toxic Plan That Will Create More Division, Damage to Our 
                          Kids and Communities

       Statement of Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, Executive Director 
     and CEO of MomsRising, the online and on-the-ground 
     organization of more than one million mothers and their 
     families, on the so-called `Parents Bill of Rights' (H.R. 5) 
     House Republicans are poised to pass this week:
       ``The badly misnamed `Parents Bill of Rights' the House GOP 
     plans to vote on this week is all wrong for America's moms, 
     kids, families, and educators. It is a recipe for censorship, 
     bullying and book bans, and for division based on race, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, masquerading as a 
     bill of rights. If it were to become law, the Parents Bill of 
     Rights would create more division by pitting educators 
     against parents. It would do enormous damage to our kids, 
     schools and communities.
       ``America's moms want schools to be safe and inclusive and 
     to value diversity; for parents to be respectful; and for 
     educators to be able to be honest about their identities and 
     allowed to teach our country's truths, good and bad, and the 
     values that got us to where we are today. We want our 
     children to learn about the history and obstacles faced, and 
     overcome, by members of our Black, Brown, AAPI, Native 
     American, immigrant, religious-minority, LGBTQ+, and other 
     communities. We want our students to be able to access 
     unbiased health information. We want all our youth, 
     regardless of income, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, to be safe and 
     included in schools that prepare them to contribute to and 
     succeed in our society.
       ``And we want a society that rejects `us vs. them' and puts 
     in place the caregiving and other supports that will allow 
     all families to succeed. MomsRising has more than a million 
     members and we have been working closely with moms in every 
     state for more than a decade. What this country's moms want 
     from Congress is affordable child, elder and disability care; 
     paid family and medical leave; fair pay; health care and 
     medications we can afford; vastly improved maternal health 
     care for all of us; the ability to make our own decisions 
     about if, when and how many children to have; and laws that 
     will end the scourge of gun violence and keep our children, 
     streets, schools and communities safe.
       ``Coming soon, we will release the Moms Rising for Freedom 
     Agenda with ten key policies lawmakers should support that 
     moms across the Nation really want, instead of the divisive 
     and harmful policies in the `Parents Bill of Rights.' That is 
     how we build a society in which we can all flourish and 
     thrive.''
  Mr. TAKANO. In committee, my Republican colleagues have preached 
about parents' God-given rights. I will tell you now that children have 
a God-given right not to be physically or emotionally harmed.
  As a teacher, I know of instances where children were outed by staff, 
and as a consequence those children faced severe punishment at home. 
One student was viciously beaten by his father and transferred out of a 
district after his family was informed that he was caught being 
physically affectionate with another boy.
  Imagine the situation in which educators are placed when government 
requires them to out their student to an unsupportive family. I will 
tell you what happens to those kids:
  73 percent of LGBTQ youth report anxiety.
  58 percent of them report depression.
  40 percent of homeless youth are LGBTQ, and
  46 percent, nearly half of them, have seriously considered suicide.
  Good teachers care about their kids. Good teachers know that a 
relationship with parents is important. But when a home is not safe for 
LGBTQ kids, school becomes their safe place, and teachers need to be 
their cheerleaders, not their first bullies.
  This bill forces good teachers to do bad things. It alienates 
students from their parents. It outs kids. It forces kids back into the 
closet. It is a fundamental invasion of privacy that puts children in 
danger.
  In the first 3 months that this Congress has been in session, this is 
what

[[Page H1351]]

Republicans have chosen to spend our time and taxpayer dollars on. The 
so-called Parents Bill of Rights Act is the exact type of Big 
Government overreach my colleagues across the aisle proclaim they are 
against, and puts the cost of their pursuit of political gain on the 
backs of students and teachers.
  This is worse than simply bad legislation. It is a concerted attack 
on children, parents, and teachers.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the bill.

                              {time}  1445

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the 
Parents Bill of Rights Act. I thank Representative Letlow and Chair 
Foxx for their leadership in defending the God-given rights of parents 
and protecting kids as well.
  Parental involvement in their children's education is paramount to a 
student's success. However, in recent years, we have seen a push by 
some to exclude parents from their children's education. This is why I 
recently introduced the PROTECT Kids Act with Senator Tim Scott which 
has been included as an amendment to H.R. 5.
  The PROTECT Kids Act would require any Department of Education-funded 
elementary or middle school to seek and acquire parental consent before 
changing their child's pronouns or preferred name on any school form.
  This provision is straightforward, common sense, and will safeguard 
the critical relationship between parents, schools, and children.
  When a child goes on a field trip or fails a test, their parents are 
told and are often required to sign an acknowledgment or a permission 
slip.
  Why should relatively small things require notification but something 
as significant as a child's pronouns or a change in accommodations can 
be withheld from the people who raise and love them?
  Recent polling shows this has the broad support of the American 
people. Three-quarters of Americans believe schools should be required 
to obtain consent from parents.
  Parents have a fundamental right to raise and educate their children 
how they choose. We must pass the Parents Bill of Rights Act to help 
mitigate issues we have seen nationwide and to support parents who need 
the support to do right by their kids as well.
  On this side of the aisle, we believe this is the right way to go, 
and we believe that in the end it will promote education, family, and 
individualism as well.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is a member of the 
Committee on Education and the Workforce.
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, Congress should be supporting parents, 
students, and teachers, not advancing this politics over parents act 
which would punish teachers for giving history lessons, ban books, and 
sow hate and divisiveness against trans kids.
  Parents have the utmost confidence in their kids' teachers. When it 
comes to writing curricula, 76 percent of parents trust their child's 
school. But when it comes to writing laws, political gimmicks, like 
this bill, keep them from saying the same thing about this very body.
  Instead of manufacturing outrage over curricula and books, why don't 
we just listen?
  Mr. Chairman, 84 percent of parents would rather Congress give free 
school meals, and 79 percent want support for mental health services. 
In a survey of parents' top concerns by The Pew Charitable Trusts, 40 
percent said they were extremely or very worried about their children 
struggling with depression, 35 percent said they were concerned about 
bullying, and 22 percent were worried about their kids being shot.
  Not a single one of those issues on the top list of parental concerns 
is addressed in this bill. So don't tell me this is a parents' bill of 
rights. This is not addressing gun violence. It is not addressing 
mental health. It is not addressing childcare, pre-K, and all of the 
other things that would be a part of a parents' bill of rights.
  Instead, we are spending time on a bill that sows doubt about public 
education and our teachers and also targets our very vulnerable trans 
kids who are absolutely no threat to anyone in this body.
  Please understand that the provisions in this bill that out trans 
kids are cruel and dangerous. I say that as a mom of a trans kid. I was 
very embracing to my daughter when she came out, but not every family 
is. The reality is that 75 percent of trans kids experience 
discrimination and harassment.
  So why do Republicans want schools to require outing LGBTQ students?
  That does not make them better students.
  Congress has the constitutional authority to write laws. What a 
mockery and betrayal of that duty it would be to pass this stunt of a 
bill that doesn't address a single priority of parents, bans books, 
undermines teachers, and hurts our kids.
  Democrats are the party of parents and families. We reject this bill, 
and we commit to fighting for childcare, for universal pre-K, for a 
child tax credit, and for the ability of people to be free for who they 
are and express themselves.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two letters. One is from the 
National Education Association, and one is from the American Federation 
of Teachers.

                               National Education Association,

                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.
     U.S. House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 3 million members of 
     the National Education Association, dedicated and trusted 
     professionals who teach and support nearly 50 million 
     students in public schools across America, we urge you to 
     vote NO on H.R. 5. Votes related to this bill, including 
     extreme amendments that would create a national private 
     school voucher program, may be included in the NEA Report 
     Card for the 118th Congress.
       H.R. 5 is unnecessary and ignores the partnerships that 
     exist between parents and educators. Parents and guardians 
     already have the right and the opportunity to partner with 
     educators to ensure students have the learning opportunities, 
     resources, and support for success. Across America, parents

                       PARENTS BILL OF RIGHTS ACT


                             General Leave

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 5.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 241 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 5.
  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Flood) to preside 
over the Committee of the Whole.

                              {time}  1420


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 5) to ensure the rights of parents are honored and protected in 
the Nation's public schools, with Mr. Flood in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the 
first time.
  General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 2 
hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce or their 
respective designees.
  The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Scott) each will control 1 hour.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today to recognize the profound importance of H.R. 
5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and what it means for families 
across the country.
  Over the past several years, parents witnessed the consequences of 
lessons taught in classrooms firsthand. Math scores declined by the 
largest margin ever, and reading scores plummeted to the lowest levels 
in over three decades. These results are devastating.
  Teachers' unions and education bureaucrats worked to push progressive 
politics in classrooms while keeping parents in the dark. The Parents 
Bill of Rights Act aims to end that and shine a light on what is 
happening in schools. This bill will reaffirm a parent's right to 
review course curriculum, meet with the child's teacher, and be heard 
at school board meetings without fear of reprisal.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem convinced 
Republicans are using this bill to punish teachers or push an extreme 
rightwing agenda. This is false.
  Our education system is spiraling out of control as parents are 
pushed further outside the classroom. This bill will restore the role 
of parents in schools and provide new mechanisms to promote parent-
teacher partnerships.
  When parents are involved in their child's education, students 
thrive. That is the guiding principle of this bill. With the Parents 
Bill of Rights Act, Republicans will help parents steer the education 
of their children back onto the correct path where they can learn the 
skills they need for a lifetime of success.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the politics over parents 
act.
  First, let me be clear. House Democrats believe parental engagement 
is central to student success. Parental engagement in schools is 
closely linked to better student behavior, higher academic achievement, 
and enhanced social skills.
  Unfortunately, the politics over parents act does not take meaningful 
steps to increase or support parental engagement. In fact, it lists so-
called rights and then declares that this allows the parents to control 
what is taught. Let's be clear: There is nothing in the bill to give 
parents the right to dictate what their children are taught.
  Instead, this bill is one of many attempts by Republican politicians 
to give a vocal minority the power to try to impose their beliefs on 
all parents and students. This extreme education agenda has real 
consequences for students and educators.
  According to PEN America, over 2,500 books were banned in schools 
during the school year 2021-2022, and nearly 140 additional book bans 
have taken effect since July 2022.
  Let me just list some of the books that Republican politicians have 
gotten banned under the guise of parental rights: ``Diary of a Young 
Girl,'' the stories of a Holocaust survivor, by Anne Frank; ``The Kite 
Runner,'' a novel on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, by Khaled 
Hosseini; ``Beloved,'' a novel about slaves during the Civil War, by 
Toni Morrison; and on and on. Books like that have been banned because 
of efforts like what we have before us today.
  Let's be clear. These books are taught at age-appropriate levels. If 
you have a problem with it, you should call the librarian. Yet, 
Republican politicians are actually having them removed from classrooms 
and school libraries.
  Simply put, the politics over parents act is an educational gag order 
across the Nation which will prevent students from learning and prevent 
teachers from teaching. These efforts seek to score political points 
and scare parents into thinking that schools do not have their best 
interests at heart. Instead, we should be talking about the support 
that schools and families actually need to improve parent-teacher 
engagement.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the politics over 
parents act and join House Democrats in an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to deliver real solutions to build partnerships between 
schools and families.

  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Louisiana (Ms. Letlow).
  Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Chair, I rise today to join my voice with millions of 
American parents as the House considers H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of 
Rights Act.
  H.R. 5 is about one simple and fundamental principle: Parents should 
always have a seat at the table when it comes to their child's 
education.
  We believe that learning is a partnership between a family and their 
child's teachers. This bill is the vehicle by which we can put parents 
and educators together at the same table to have a productive dialogue.
  This bill is not complex or complicated, nor should it be partisan or 
polarizing. Contrary to what you may hear from my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, it is not an attack on our hardworking 
teachers, who will always be the heroes in my eyes. It is not an 
attempt to have Congress dictate the curriculum or determine the books 
in the library. Instead, this bill aims to bring more transparency and 
accountability to education, allowing parents to be informed and, when 
they have questions and concerns, to lawfully bring them to their local 
school boards.
  Over the past 2 years, we have seen too many instances where rather 
than opening their doors to welcome parents in as partners, some 
schools instead slammed them shut and said that government bureaucrats 
know what is best for our children.
  Parents across this country have overwhelmingly spoken out that they 
have had enough. They want a seat at the table because, at the end of 
the day, these are our children, not the government's.

[[Page H1349]]

  Mr. Chair, I worked in education before I came to Congress, and I am 
also a mom. I have seen firsthand how when you educate a child, you 
give them a future.
  We know that when parents are involved, it is the students who 
succeed. We also know that when a family is shut out of their child's 
education, it will lead to disastrous results.

                              {time}  1430

  Mr. Chair, let us give parents that voice in the learning process. 
Let schools open the doors and welcome them in as partners. Let us work 
together to build a brighter future for America's children.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), the ranking member on the Higher 
Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee.
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 
5. As an educator, I believe parent voices should be honored in 
schools. All educators believe this.
  We know that this bill is not about that at all. We have always had 
parents involved in our schools, so stop being foolish and divisive. We 
always need their input.
  This bill is nothing more than a talking point of the extreme MAGA 
agenda that will hurt children and hurt our schools. Let's face it--
there has been a movement to eliminate public education since the 1954 
Brown v. Board of Education decision.
  With the election of our President 7 years ago, it pulled the scab of 
a wound that never healed. Now it is an open, gaping wound, and it is 
out of control. They are throwing everything at public schools but the 
kitchen sink: vouchers, excessive testing, poorly paid teachers, 
banning books, and now they are trying to drive a wedge and create an 
antagonistic relationship between schools and their parents. How 
pathetic. How dreadful.
  Parents love teachers. Everybody loves teachers. Every parent has an 
``I love and remember a teacher'' story. How disgraceful that we want 
to terrorize the very people who love our children, keep them safe, and 
educate them for over 8 hours daily. Our teachers are sacrificial 
lambs.
  You will never eliminate public schools. We will fight you as long as 
it takes. This is all that the little children who look like me have. 
Public schools are the bedrock of this Nation.
  Let me tell you what a parent's bill of rights should include. I will 
call it the parents' 10 commandments:
  Thou shalt restore the Child Tax Credit; provide free, hot breakfast 
and lunch; provide free pre-K and free community college.
  Thou shalt end the school-to-prison pipeline; put a nurse in every 
school; offer after-school activities; provide intensive counseling 
services, particularly to address school shootings.
  Thou shalt offer parents the right to improve their education and job 
skills, love and respect every child's individuality, guarantee that 
every child's teacher will make a minimum of $60,000 a year.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Bean), chair of the Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary 
Education Subcommittee.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Chair, should parents have the right to be 
involved in their child's education?
  That is the question before us. Seventy-two percent of Americans have 
answered ``yes'' to that question. Parents should be and want to be 
involved in their child's education.
  According to numerous studies, students who have involved parents 
have better behavior, better grades, better attendance, and develop a 
lifelong love of learning, which is the key to long-term success.
  Today, American parents are fed up, largely because they have 
experienced 2 years of school closures, misguided COVID policies, 
disastrous remote learning, and a curriculum focused on what is woke 
rather than what is essential academic instruction. They have been 
branded ``domestic terrorists'' for speaking out at school boards. Some 
were even arrested for having the nerve to plead with school boards 
about the safety of their child at school.
  Mr. Chair, it is time to re-welcome parents back into education. It 
is time for parents to have the right to know what is going on in 
American education today. That is why I--and I encourage everybody--to 
support H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, critical legislation 
that empowers parents and prioritizes the needs of students over 
entrenched special interest groups.
  Today, this body has an extraordinary opportunity to reclaim the 
moral high ground in America and usher in a newer era of K-12 education 
that empowers parents, protects kids, and expands educational freedom.
  American parents have said they want to be a part of their children's 
education. It is time for this body to say ``yes'' and support parents.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the ranking member of the Early 
Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction of the bill.
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 
5, which should be called the politics over parents act.
  After spending 15 years as a very involved public school parent, I 
can say without hesitation that I strongly support parental involvement 
in education. You won't meet a Member on this side of the aisle that 
disagrees with that. The bill before us today misses the mark.
  This could have been an opportunity to address the real challenges 
facing education, to make changes that would involve parents in a 
constructive way, and also make a positive difference in education. I 
am disappointed that we aren't doing that.
  House Democrats have shown time and time again that we are committed 
to providing all parents--including those who traditionally face 
barriers to engagement--with meaningful involvement in their kids' 
schools. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Democratic 
Party is the party of parental rights and family values.
  We have put forward a substantive plan that will actually increase 
the frequency, quality, and accessibility of parental involvement and 
engagement in schools; a substantive plan that invests in evidence-
based models and support systems that have been shown to increase 
family engagement and improve student achievement; a substantive plan 
that encourages parents to be partners, not adversaries, in their 
children's education; a substantive plan that roots out discrimination 
based on race, disability, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or 
gender identity in our public schools; a substantive plan that, unlike 
H.R. 5, doesn't carry dangerous, authoritarian undertones encouraging 
book bans, discouraging the teaching of scientifically and historically 
accurate curricula, and leading to the micromanagement of the work of 
educators.

  We welcome a conversation about how to empower parents, and urge our 
friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle to abandon their 
politically motivated attacks on schoolteachers and students. We should 
instead be working together on these issues in a bipartisan manner. Our 
Nation's students and families deserve that.
  We need more parents, including those from diverse backgrounds, to 
feel included, supported, engaged, and welcomed at their kids' school. 
This bill does not even begin to do that.
  I am leading more than 45 of our colleagues on a Bill of Rights for 
Students and Parents, a resolution that is supported by more than 250 
education, civil rights, and parents' groups, including the National 
PTA.
  I have heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that 
history will judge us on how we respond to the needs of students and 
families at this moment, and I agree with them.
  Will we succumb to an extremist, discriminatory, narrow-minded, anti-
public-education agenda, or will we work together to advance 
commonsense, meaningful policies that will support parents, students, 
and educators?
  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to take the approach that 
still sees public education as the great equalizer for all students 
regardless of who they are or where they are from, essential to our 
communities, the economy, and our democratic Republic.
  Please join me in rejecting this bill.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a statement from the National PTA 
in opposition to H.R. 5.


[[Page H1350]]


       Dear Representative Bobby Scott: National PTA and our 
     network of millions of parents and educators across the 
     country urge you to support adoption of the Bonamici 
     Substitute Amendment and oppose the underlying legislation, 
     H.R. 5, on the House Floor tomorrow.
       PTA opposes the underlying bill, H.R. 5, because it has the 
     potential to cause significant harm to children and families. 
     If passed as written, H.R. 5 could:
       Prevent mental health support for students in need;
       Limit access to learning-enhancing technology and 
     educational materials;
       Lead to inappropriate and harmful book bans and curriculum 
     censorship;
       Create confusion for school staff and burdensome opt-in 
     requirements for families;
       Impair relationships between educators and parents; and
       Undermine efforts to create safe, welcoming, supportive, 
     and inclusive learning environments for all students and 
     families.
       PTA supports Representative Bonamici's Substitute Amendment 
     to H.R. 5 as the ONLY PATH forward to ensuring supports and 
     services are in place for true family-school partnerships. We 
     stand behind our National Standards for Family-School 
     Partnerships that have been in place for over 20 years. The 
     Substitute Amendment provides the opportunity for meaningful 
     and inclusive family engagement in K-12 education and if 
     adopted would replace the current H.R. 5 and enable our 
     Nation's public schools to:
       Create a parent coordinator position in public schools;
       Reinforce existing parents' rights under federal law;
       Prohibit the federal government from curriculum censorship 
     and banning books; and
       Invest in full-service community schools and Statewide 
     Family Engagement Centers Program (the new authorization 
     level of $60 million would allow all states to participate).
       As the Nation's oldest and largest child advocacy 
     association, we know what meaningful family engagement looks 
     like and what parents want from their policymakers. We ask 
     you to join us in supporting the Bonamici Substitute 
     Amendment and opposing the underlying bill, H.R. 5 on the 
     House Floor. We thank you for consideration of this request 
     and if you have any questions, please reach out to our 
     Director of Government Affairs, Kate Clabaugh.

longer recognized.


                         Parliamentary Inquiry

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Was the gentlewoman's request to introduce a 
statement recognized?
  The CHAIR. That request is covered under general leave.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the chair of the Agriculture Committee.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong 
support of the Parents Bill of Rights Act. This legislation is just one 
of many promises we intend to keep in our ``Commitment to America.''
  As a recovering school board member, I know firsthand the importance 
of hearing from parents and encouraging them to be engaged in their 
child's education.
  The Parents Bill of Rights Act provides parents an expanded 
opportunity to engage with their children and the teachers who educate 
them. This bill implements clear, commonsense protections allowing 
parents to easily review curriculum information, academic standards, 
and see how schools are spending our tax dollars.
  Parents deserve the right to be heard and should be able to raise 
concerns and address their school board without fear of harassment or 
retribution.
  This bill includes simple protections to keep our children safe, from 
protecting their privacy to requiring parents to be notified of violent 
activity in the school.
  As a graduate of the public school system and having raised three 
sons in the very same school district, I know parental involvement is 
critical to fostering a successful educational environment.
  Mr. Chair, quite simply, this bill is common sense. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation that ensures parents are at the 
center of their child's educational experience.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the 
Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
politics over parents act as a member of the Education and the 
Workforce Committee, as a member of the LGBTQ community, but above all, 
as a teacher.
  I am an educator and I know how important parental involvement is. 
All parents, including the parents of LGBTQ kids, have rights. They 
have rights to send their children to schools where they will be 
affirmed, protected, and free from harassment, and given the 
opportunity to thrive. They have a right to be free from bullying and 
humiliation.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from a million 
MomsRising.

                            [Mar. 21, 2023]

  So-Called `Parents Bill of Rights' Is All Wrong for America's Moms, 
 Families--A Toxic Plan That Will Create More Division, Damage to Our 
                          Kids and Communities

       Statement of Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, Executive Director 
     and CEO of MomsRising, the online and on-the-ground 
     organization of more than one million mothers and their 
     families, on the so-called `Parents Bill of Rights' (H.R. 5) 
     House Republicans are poised to pass this week:
       ``The badly misnamed `Parents Bill of Rights' the House GOP 
     plans to vote on this week is all wrong for America's moms, 
     kids, families, and educators. It is a recipe for censorship, 
     bullying and book bans, and for division based on race, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, masquerading as a 
     bill of rights. If it were to become law, the Parents Bill of 
     Rights would create more division by pitting educators 
     against parents. It would do enormous damage to our kids, 
     schools and communities.
       ``America's moms want schools to be safe and inclusive and 
     to value diversity; for parents to be respectful; and for 
     educators to be able to be honest about their identities and 
     allowed to teach our country's truths, good and bad, and the 
     values that got us to where we are today. We want our 
     children to learn about the history and obstacles faced, and 
     overcome, by members of our Black, Brown, AAPI, Native 
     American, immigrant, religious-minority, LGBTQ+, and other 
     communities. We want our students to be able to access 
     unbiased health information. We want all our youth, 
     regardless of income, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, to be safe and 
     included in schools that prepare them to contribute to and 
     succeed in our society.
       ``And we want a society that rejects `us vs. them' and puts 
     in place the caregiving and other supports that will allow 
     all families to succeed. MomsRising has more than a million 
     members and we have been working closely with moms in every 
     state for more than a decade. What this country's moms want 
     from Congress is affordable child, elder and disability care; 
     paid family and medical leave; fair pay; health care and 
     medications we can afford; vastly improved maternal health 
     care for all of us; the ability to make our own decisions 
     about if, when and how many children to have; and laws that 
     will end the scourge of gun violence and keep our children, 
     streets, schools and communities safe.
       ``Coming soon, we will release the Moms Rising for Freedom 
     Agenda with ten key policies lawmakers should support that 
     moms across the Nation really want, instead of the divisive 
     and harmful policies in the `Parents Bill of Rights.' That is 
     how we build a society in which we can all flourish and 
     thrive.''
  Mr. TAKANO. In committee, my Republican colleagues have preached 
about parents' God-given rights. I will tell you now that children have 
a God-given right not to be physically or emotionally harmed.
  As a teacher, I know of instances where children were outed by staff, 
and as a consequence those children faced severe punishment at home. 
One student was viciously beaten by his father and transferred out of a 
district after his family was informed that he was caught being 
physically affectionate with another boy.
  Imagine the situation in which educators are placed when government 
requires them to out their student to an unsupportive family. I will 
tell you what happens to those kids:
  73 percent of LGBTQ youth report anxiety.
  58 percent of them report depression.
  40 percent of homeless youth are LGBTQ, and
  46 percent, nearly half of them, have seriously considered suicide.
  Good teachers care about their kids. Good teachers know that a 
relationship with parents is important. But when a home is not safe for 
LGBTQ kids, school becomes their safe place, and teachers need to be 
their cheerleaders, not their first bullies.
  This bill forces good teachers to do bad things. It alienates 
students from their parents. It outs kids. It forces kids back into the 
closet. It is a fundamental invasion of privacy that puts children in 
danger.
  In the first 3 months that this Congress has been in session, this is 
what

[[Page H1351]]

Republicans have chosen to spend our time and taxpayer dollars on. The 
so-called Parents Bill of Rights Act is the exact type of Big 
Government overreach my colleagues across the aisle proclaim they are 
against, and puts the cost of their pursuit of political gain on the 
backs of students and teachers.
  This is worse than simply bad legislation. It is a concerted attack 
on children, parents, and teachers.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the bill.

                              {time}  1445

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the 
Parents Bill of Rights Act. I thank Representative Letlow and Chair 
Foxx for their leadership in defending the God-given rights of parents 
and protecting kids as well.
  Parental involvement in their children's education is paramount to a 
student's success. However, in recent years, we have seen a push by 
some to exclude parents from their children's education. This is why I 
recently introduced the PROTECT Kids Act with Senator Tim Scott which 
has been included as an amendment to H.R. 5.
  The PROTECT Kids Act would require any Department of Education-funded 
elementary or middle school to seek and acquire parental consent before 
changing their child's pronouns or preferred name on any school form.
  This provision is straightforward, common sense, and will safeguard 
the critical relationship between parents, schools, and children.
  When a child goes on a field trip or fails a test, their parents are 
told and are often required to sign an acknowledgment or a permission 
slip.
  Why should relatively small things require notification but something 
as significant as a child's pronouns or a change in accommodations can 
be withheld from the people who raise and love them?
  Recent polling shows this has the broad support of the American 
people. Three-quarters of Americans believe schools should be required 
to obtain consent from parents.
  Parents have a fundamental right to raise and educate their children 
how they choose. We must pass the Parents Bill of Rights Act to help 
mitigate issues we have seen nationwide and to support parents who need 
the support to do right by their kids as well.
  On this side of the aisle, we believe this is the right way to go, 
and we believe that in the end it will promote education, family, and 
individualism as well.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is a member of the 
Committee on Education and the Workforce.
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, Congress should be supporting parents, 
students, and teachers, not advancing this politics over parents act 
which would punish teachers for giving history lessons, ban books, and 
sow hate and divisiveness against trans kids.
  Parents have the utmost confidence in their kids' teachers. When it 
comes to writing curricula, 76 percent of parents trust their child's 
school. But when it comes to writing laws, political gimmicks, like 
this bill, keep them from saying the same thing about this very body.
  Instead of manufacturing outrage over curricula and books, why don't 
we just listen?
  Mr. Chairman, 84 percent of parents would rather Congress give free 
school meals, and 79 percent want support for mental health services. 
In a survey of parents' top concerns by The Pew Charitable Trusts, 40 
percent said they were extremely or very worried about their children 
struggling with depression, 35 percent said they were concerned about 
bullying, and 22 percent were worried about their kids being shot.
  Not a single one of those issues on the top list of parental concerns 
is addressed in this bill. So don't tell me this is a parents' bill of 
rights. This is not addressing gun violence. It is not addressing 
mental health. It is not addressing childcare, pre-K, and all of the 
other things that would be a part of a parents' bill of rights.
  Instead, we are spending time on a bill that sows doubt about public 
education and our teachers and also targets our very vulnerable trans 
kids who are absolutely no threat to anyone in this body.
  Please understand that the provisions in this bill that out trans 
kids are cruel and dangerous. I say that as a mom of a trans kid. I was 
very embracing to my daughter when she came out, but not every family 
is. The reality is that 75 percent of trans kids experience 
discrimination and harassment.
  So why do Republicans want schools to require outing LGBTQ students?
  That does not make them better students.
  Congress has the constitutional authority to write laws. What a 
mockery and betrayal of that duty it would be to pass this stunt of a 
bill that doesn't address a single priority of parents, bans books, 
undermines teachers, and hurts our kids.
  Democrats are the party of parents and families. We reject this bill, 
and we commit to fighting for childcare, for universal pre-K, for a 
child tax credit, and for the ability of people to be free for who they 
are and express themselves.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two letters. One is from the 
National Education Association, and one is from the American Federation 
of Teachers.

                               National Education Association,

                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.
     U.S. House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 3 million members of 
     the National Education Association, dedicated and trusted 
     professionals who teach and support nearly 50 million 
     students in public schools across America, we urge you to 
     vote NO on H.R. 5. Votes related to this bill, including 
     extreme amendments that would create a national private 
     school voucher program, may be included in the NEA Report 
     Card for the 118th Congress.
       H.R. 5 is unnecessary and ignores the partnerships that 
     exist between parents and educators. Parents and guardians 
     already have the right and the opportunity to partner with 
     educators to ensure students have the learning opportunities, 
     resources, and support for success. Across America, parents 
     are strategizing with educators when children face hurdles 
     and celebrating with them when students achieve milestones, 
     volunteering at events, chaperoning field trips, leading 
     PTAs,",

                       PARENTS BILL OF RIGHTS ACT


                             General Leave

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 5.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 241 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 5.
  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Flood) to preside 
over the Committee of the Whole.

                              {time}  1420


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 5) to ensure the rights of parents are honored and protected in 
the Nation's public schools, with Mr. Flood in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the 
first time.
  General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 2 
hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce or their 
respective designees.
  The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Scott) each will control 1 hour.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today to recognize the profound importance of H.R. 
5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and what it means for families 
across the country.
  Over the past several years, parents witnessed the consequences of 
lessons taught in classrooms firsthand. Math scores declined by the 
largest margin ever, and reading scores plummeted to the lowest levels 
in over three decades. These results are devastating.
  Teachers' unions and education bureaucrats worked to push progressive 
politics in classrooms while keeping parents in the dark. The Parents 
Bill of Rights Act aims to end that and shine a light on what is 
happening in schools. This bill will reaffirm a parent's right to 
review course curriculum, meet with the child's teacher, and be heard 
at school board meetings without fear of reprisal.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem convinced 
Republicans are using this bill to punish teachers or push an extreme 
rightwing agenda. This is false.
  Our education system is spiraling out of control as parents are 
pushed further outside the classroom. This bill will restore the role 
of parents in schools and provide new mechanisms to promote parent-
teacher partnerships.
  When parents are involved in their child's education, students 
thrive. That is the guiding principle of this bill. With the Parents 
Bill of Rights Act, Republicans will help parents steer the education 
of their children back onto the correct path where they can learn the 
skills they need for a lifetime of success.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the politics over parents 
act.
  First, let me be clear. House Democrats believe parental engagement 
is central to student success. Parental engagement in schools is 
closely linked to better student behavior, higher academic achievement, 
and enhanced social skills.
  Unfortunately, the politics over parents act does not take meaningful 
steps to increase or support parental engagement. In fact, it lists so-
called rights and then declares that this allows the parents to control 
what is taught. Let's be clear: There is nothing in the bill to give 
parents the right to dictate what their children are taught.
  Instead, this bill is one of many attempts by Republican politicians 
to give a vocal minority the power to try to impose their beliefs on 
all parents and students. This extreme education agenda has real 
consequences for students and educators.
  According to PEN America, over 2,500 books were banned in schools 
during the school year 2021-2022, and nearly 140 additional book bans 
have taken effect since July 2022.
  Let me just list some of the books that Republican politicians have 
gotten banned under the guise of parental rights: ``Diary of a Young 
Girl,'' the stories of a Holocaust survivor, by Anne Frank; ``The Kite 
Runner,'' a novel on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, by Khaled 
Hosseini; ``Beloved,'' a novel about slaves during the Civil War, by 
Toni Morrison; and on and on. Books like that have been banned because 
of efforts like what we have before us today.
  Let's be clear. These books are taught at age-appropriate levels. If 
you have a problem with it, you should call the librarian. Yet, 
Republican politicians are actually having them removed from classrooms 
and school libraries.
  Simply put, the politics over parents act is an educational gag order 
across the Nation which will prevent students from learning and prevent 
teachers from teaching. These efforts seek to score political points 
and scare parents into thinking that schools do not have their best 
interests at heart. Instead, we should be talking about the support 
that schools and families actually need to improve parent-teacher 
engagement.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the politics over 
parents act and join House Democrats in an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to deliver real solutions to build partnerships between 
schools and families.

  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Louisiana (Ms. Letlow).
  Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Chair, I rise today to join my voice with millions of 
American parents as the House considers H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of 
Rights Act.
  H.R. 5 is about one simple and fundamental principle: Parents should 
always have a seat at the table when it comes to their child's 
education.
  We believe that learning is a partnership between a family and their 
child's teachers. This bill is the vehicle by which we can put parents 
and educators together at the same table to have a productive dialogue.
  This bill is not complex or complicated, nor should it be partisan or 
polarizing. Contrary to what you may hear from my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, it is not an attack on our hardworking 
teachers, who will always be the heroes in my eyes. It is not an 
attempt to have Congress dictate the curriculum or determine the books 
in the library. Instead, this bill aims to bring more transparency and 
accountability to education, allowing parents to be informed and, when 
they have questions and concerns, to lawfully bring them to their local 
school boards.
  Over the past 2 years, we have seen too many instances where rather 
than opening their doors to welcome parents in as partners, some 
schools instead slammed them shut and said that government bureaucrats 
know what is best for our children.
  Parents across this country have overwhelmingly spoken out that they 
have had enough. They want a seat at the table because, at the end of 
the day, these are our children, not the government's.

[[Page H1349]]

  Mr. Chair, I worked in education before I came to Congress, and I am 
also a mom. I have seen firsthand how when you educate a child, you 
give them a future.
  We know that when parents are involved, it is the students who 
succeed. We also know that when a family is shut out of their child's 
education, it will lead to disastrous results.

                              {time}  1430

  Mr. Chair, let us give parents that voice in the learning process. 
Let schools open the doors and welcome them in as partners. Let us work 
together to build a brighter future for America's children.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), the ranking member on the Higher 
Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee.
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 
5. As an educator, I believe parent voices should be honored in 
schools. All educators believe this.
  We know that this bill is not about that at all. We have always had 
parents involved in our schools, so stop being foolish and divisive. We 
always need their input.
  This bill is nothing more than a talking point of the extreme MAGA 
agenda that will hurt children and hurt our schools. Let's face it--
there has been a movement to eliminate public education since the 1954 
Brown v. Board of Education decision.
  With the election of our President 7 years ago, it pulled the scab of 
a wound that never healed. Now it is an open, gaping wound, and it is 
out of control. They are throwing everything at public schools but the 
kitchen sink: vouchers, excessive testing, poorly paid teachers, 
banning books, and now they are trying to drive a wedge and create an 
antagonistic relationship between schools and their parents. How 
pathetic. How dreadful.
  Parents love teachers. Everybody loves teachers. Every parent has an 
``I love and remember a teacher'' story. How disgraceful that we want 
to terrorize the very people who love our children, keep them safe, and 
educate them for over 8 hours daily. Our teachers are sacrificial 
lambs.
  You will never eliminate public schools. We will fight you as long as 
it takes. This is all that the little children who look like me have. 
Public schools are the bedrock of this Nation.
  Let me tell you what a parent's bill of rights should include. I will 
call it the parents' 10 commandments:
  Thou shalt restore the Child Tax Credit; provide free, hot breakfast 
and lunch; provide free pre-K and free community college.
  Thou shalt end the school-to-prison pipeline; put a nurse in every 
school; offer after-school activities; provide intensive counseling 
services, particularly to address school shootings.
  Thou shalt offer parents the right to improve their education and job 
skills, love and respect every child's individuality, guarantee that 
every child's teacher will make a minimum of $60,000 a year.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Bean), chair of the Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary 
Education Subcommittee.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Chair, should parents have the right to be 
involved in their child's education?
  That is the question before us. Seventy-two percent of Americans have 
answered ``yes'' to that question. Parents should be and want to be 
involved in their child's education.
  According to numerous studies, students who have involved parents 
have better behavior, better grades, better attendance, and develop a 
lifelong love of learning, which is the key to long-term success.
  Today, American parents are fed up, largely because they have 
experienced 2 years of school closures, misguided COVID policies, 
disastrous remote learning, and a curriculum focused on what is woke 
rather than what is essential academic instruction. They have been 
branded ``domestic terrorists'' for speaking out at school boards. Some 
were even arrested for having the nerve to plead with school boards 
about the safety of their child at school.
  Mr. Chair, it is time to re-welcome parents back into education. It 
is time for parents to have the right to know what is going on in 
American education today. That is why I--and I encourage everybody--to 
support H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, critical legislation 
that empowers parents and prioritizes the needs of students over 
entrenched special interest groups.
  Today, this body has an extraordinary opportunity to reclaim the 
moral high ground in America and usher in a newer era of K-12 education 
that empowers parents, protects kids, and expands educational freedom.
  American parents have said they want to be a part of their children's 
education. It is time for this body to say ``yes'' and support parents.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the ranking member of the Early 
Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction of the bill.
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 
5, which should be called the politics over parents act.
  After spending 15 years as a very involved public school parent, I 
can say without hesitation that I strongly support parental involvement 
in education. You won't meet a Member on this side of the aisle that 
disagrees with that. The bill before us today misses the mark.
  This could have been an opportunity to address the real challenges 
facing education, to make changes that would involve parents in a 
constructive way, and also make a positive difference in education. I 
am disappointed that we aren't doing that.
  House Democrats have shown time and time again that we are committed 
to providing all parents--including those who traditionally face 
barriers to engagement--with meaningful involvement in their kids' 
schools. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Democratic 
Party is the party of parental rights and family values.
  We have put forward a substantive plan that will actually increase 
the frequency, quality, and accessibility of parental involvement and 
engagement in schools; a substantive plan that invests in evidence-
based models and support systems that have been shown to increase 
family engagement and improve student achievement; a substantive plan 
that encourages parents to be partners, not adversaries, in their 
children's education; a substantive plan that roots out discrimination 
based on race, disability, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or 
gender identity in our public schools; a substantive plan that, unlike 
H.R. 5, doesn't carry dangerous, authoritarian undertones encouraging 
book bans, discouraging the teaching of scientifically and historically 
accurate curricula, and leading to the micromanagement of the work of 
educators.

  We welcome a conversation about how to empower parents, and urge our 
friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle to abandon their 
politically motivated attacks on schoolteachers and students. We should 
instead be working together on these issues in a bipartisan manner. Our 
Nation's students and families deserve that.
  We need more parents, including those from diverse backgrounds, to 
feel included, supported, engaged, and welcomed at their kids' school. 
This bill does not even begin to do that.
  I am leading more than 45 of our colleagues on a Bill of Rights for 
Students and Parents, a resolution that is supported by more than 250 
education, civil rights, and parents' groups, including the National 
PTA.
  I have heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that 
history will judge us on how we respond to the needs of students and 
families at this moment, and I agree with them.
  Will we succumb to an extremist, discriminatory, narrow-minded, anti-
public-education agenda, or will we work together to advance 
commonsense, meaningful policies that will support parents, students, 
and educators?
  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to take the approach that 
still sees public education as the great equalizer for all students 
regardless of who they are or where they are from, essential to our 
communities, the economy, and our democratic Republic.
  Please join me in rejecting this bill.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a statement from the National PTA 
in opposition to H.R. 5.


[[Page H1350]]


       Dear Representative Bobby Scott: National PTA and our 
     network of millions of parents and educators across the 
     country urge you to support adoption of the Bonamici 
     Substitute Amendment and oppose the underlying legislation, 
     H.R. 5, on the House Floor tomorrow.
       PTA opposes the underlying bill, H.R. 5, because it has the 
     potential to cause significant harm to children and families. 
     If passed as written, H.R. 5 could:
       Prevent mental health support for students in need;
       Limit access to learning-enhancing technology and 
     educational materials;
       Lead to inappropriate and harmful book bans and curriculum 
     censorship;
       Create confusion for school staff and burdensome opt-in 
     requirements for families;
       Impair relationships between educators and parents; and
       Undermine efforts to create safe, welcoming, supportive, 
     and inclusive learning environments for all students and 
     families.
       PTA supports Representative Bonamici's Substitute Amendment 
     to H.R. 5 as the ONLY PATH forward to ensuring supports and 
     services are in place for true family-school partnerships. We 
     stand behind our National Standards for Family-School 
     Partnerships that have been in place for over 20 years. The 
     Substitute Amendment provides the opportunity for meaningful 
     and inclusive family engagement in K-12 education and if 
     adopted would replace the current H.R. 5 and enable our 
     Nation's public schools to:
       Create a parent coordinator position in public schools;
       Reinforce existing parents' rights under federal law;
       Prohibit the federal government from curriculum censorship 
     and banning books; and
       Invest in full-service community schools and Statewide 
     Family Engagement Centers Program (the new authorization 
     level of $60 million would allow all states to participate).
       As the Nation's oldest and largest child advocacy 
     association, we know what meaningful family engagement looks 
     like and what parents want from their policymakers. We ask 
     you to join us in supporting the Bonamici Substitute 
     Amendment and opposing the underlying bill, H.R. 5 on the 
     House Floor. We thank you for consideration of this request 
     and if you have any questions, please reach out to our 
     Director of Government Affairs, Kate Clabaugh.

longer recognized.


                         Parliamentary Inquiry

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Was the gentlewoman's request to introduce a 
statement recognized?
  The CHAIR. That request is covered under general leave.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the chair of the Agriculture Committee.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong 
support of the Parents Bill of Rights Act. This legislation is just one 
of many promises we intend to keep in our ``Commitment to America.''
  As a recovering school board member, I know firsthand the importance 
of hearing from parents and encouraging them to be engaged in their 
child's education.
  The Parents Bill of Rights Act provides parents an expanded 
opportunity to engage with their children and the teachers who educate 
them. This bill implements clear, commonsense protections allowing 
parents to easily review curriculum information, academic standards, 
and see how schools are spending our tax dollars.
  Parents deserve the right to be heard and should be able to raise 
concerns and address their school board without fear of harassment or 
retribution.
  This bill includes simple protections to keep our children safe, from 
protecting their privacy to requiring parents to be notified of violent 
activity in the school.
  As a graduate of the public school system and having raised three 
sons in the very same school district, I know parental involvement is 
critical to fostering a successful educational environment.
  Mr. Chair, quite simply, this bill is common sense. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation that ensures parents are at the 
center of their child's educational experience.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the 
Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
politics over parents act as a member of the Education and the 
Workforce Committee, as a member of the LGBTQ community, but above all, 
as a teacher.
  I am an educator and I know how important parental involvement is. 
All parents, including the parents of LGBTQ kids, have rights. They 
have rights to send their children to schools where they will be 
affirmed, protected, and free from harassment, and given the 
opportunity to thrive. They have a right to be free from bullying and 
humiliation.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from a million 
MomsRising.

                            [Mar. 21, 2023]

  So-Called `Parents Bill of Rights' Is All Wrong for America's Moms, 
 Families--A Toxic Plan That Will Create More Division, Damage to Our 
                          Kids and Communities

       Statement of Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, Executive Director 
     and CEO of MomsRising, the online and on-the-ground 
     organization of more than one million mothers and their 
     families, on the so-called `Parents Bill of Rights' (H.R. 5) 
     House Republicans are poised to pass this week:
       ``The badly misnamed `Parents Bill of Rights' the House GOP 
     plans to vote on this week is all wrong for America's moms, 
     kids, families, and educators. It is a recipe for censorship, 
     bullying and book bans, and for division based on race, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, masquerading as a 
     bill of rights. If it were to become law, the Parents Bill of 
     Rights would create more division by pitting educators 
     against parents. It would do enormous damage to our kids, 
     schools and communities.
       ``America's moms want schools to be safe and inclusive and 
     to value diversity; for parents to be respectful; and for 
     educators to be able to be honest about their identities and 
     allowed to teach our country's truths, good and bad, and the 
     values that got us to where we are today. We want our 
     children to learn about the history and obstacles faced, and 
     overcome, by members of our Black, Brown, AAPI, Native 
     American, immigrant, religious-minority, LGBTQ+, and other 
     communities. We want our students to be able to access 
     unbiased health information. We want all our youth, 
     regardless of income, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, to be safe and 
     included in schools that prepare them to contribute to and 
     succeed in our society.
       ``And we want a society that rejects `us vs. them' and puts 
     in place the caregiving and other supports that will allow 
     all families to succeed. MomsRising has more than a million 
     members and we have been working closely with moms in every 
     state for more than a decade. What this country's moms want 
     from Congress is affordable child, elder and disability care; 
     paid family and medical leave; fair pay; health care and 
     medications we can afford; vastly improved maternal health 
     care for all of us; the ability to make our own decisions 
     about if, when and how many children to have; and laws that 
     will end the scourge of gun violence and keep our children, 
     streets, schools and communities safe.
       ``Coming soon, we will release the Moms Rising for Freedom 
     Agenda with ten key policies lawmakers should support that 
     moms across the Nation really want, instead of the divisive 
     and harmful policies in the `Parents Bill of Rights.' That is 
     how we build a society in which we can all flourish and 
     thrive.''
  Mr. TAKANO. In committee, my Republican colleagues have preached 
about parents' God-given rights. I will tell you now that children have 
a God-given right not to be physically or emotionally harmed.
  As a teacher, I know of instances where children were outed by staff, 
and as a consequence those children faced severe punishment at home. 
One student was viciously beaten by his father and transferred out of a 
district after his family was informed that he was caught being 
physically affectionate with another boy.
  Imagine the situation in which educators are placed when government 
requires them to out their student to an unsupportive family. I will 
tell you what happens to those kids:
  73 percent of LGBTQ youth report anxiety.
  58 percent of them report depression.
  40 percent of homeless youth are LGBTQ, and
  46 percent, nearly half of them, have seriously considered suicide.
  Good teachers care about their kids. Good teachers know that a 
relationship with parents is important. But when a home is not safe for 
LGBTQ kids, school becomes their safe place, and teachers need to be 
their cheerleaders, not their first bullies.
  This bill forces good teachers to do bad things. It alienates 
students from their parents. It outs kids. It forces kids back into the 
closet. It is a fundamental invasion of privacy that puts children in 
danger.
  In the first 3 months that this Congress has been in session, this is 
what

[[Page H1351]]

Republicans have chosen to spend our time and taxpayer dollars on. The 
so-called Parents Bill of Rights Act is the exact type of Big 
Government overreach my colleagues across the aisle proclaim they are 
against, and puts the cost of their pursuit of political gain on the 
backs of students and teachers.
  This is worse than simply bad legislation. It is a concerted attack 
on children, parents, and teachers.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the bill.

                              {time}  1445

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the 
Parents Bill of Rights Act. I thank Representative Letlow and Chair 
Foxx for their leadership in defending the God-given rights of parents 
and protecting kids as well.
  Parental involvement in their children's education is paramount to a 
student's success. However, in recent years, we have seen a push by 
some to exclude parents from their children's education. This is why I 
recently introduced the PROTECT Kids Act with Senator Tim Scott which 
has been included as an amendment to H.R. 5.
  The PROTECT Kids Act would require any Department of Education-funded 
elementary or middle school to seek and acquire parental consent before 
changing their child's pronouns or preferred name on any school form.
  This provision is straightforward, common sense, and will safeguard 
the critical relationship between parents, schools, and children.
  When a child goes on a field trip or fails a test, their parents are 
told and are often required to sign an acknowledgment or a permission 
slip.
  Why should relatively small things require notification but something 
as significant as a child's pronouns or a change in accommodations can 
be withheld from the people who raise and love them?
  Recent polling shows this has the broad support of the American 
people. Three-quarters of Americans believe schools should be required 
to obtain consent from parents.
  Parents have a fundamental right to raise and educate their children 
how they choose. We must pass the Parents Bill of Rights Act to help 
mitigate issues we have seen nationwide and to support parents who need 
the support to do right by their kids as well.
  On this side of the aisle, we believe this is the right way to go, 
and we believe that in the end it will promote education, family, and 
individualism as well.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is a member of the 
Committee on Education and the Workforce.
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, Congress should be supporting parents, 
students, and teachers, not advancing this politics over parents act 
which would punish teachers for giving history lessons, ban books, and 
sow hate and divisiveness against trans kids.
  Parents have the utmost confidence in their kids' teachers. When it 
comes to writing curricula, 76 percent of parents trust their child's 
school. But when it comes to writing laws, political gimmicks, like 
this bill, keep them from saying the same thing about this very body.
  Instead of manufacturing outrage over curricula and books, why don't 
we just listen?
  Mr. Chairman, 84 percent of parents would rather Congress give free 
school meals, and 79 percent want support for mental health services. 
In a survey of parents' top concerns by The Pew Charitable Trusts, 40 
percent said they were extremely or very worried about their children 
struggling with depression, 35 percent said they were concerned about 
bullying, and 22 percent were worried about their kids being shot.
  Not a single one of those issues on the top list of parental concerns 
is addressed in this bill. So don't tell me this is a parents' bill of 
rights. This is not addressing gun violence. It is not addressing 
mental health. It is not addressing childcare, pre-K, and all of the 
other things that would be a part of a parents' bill of rights.
  Instead, we are spending time on a bill that sows doubt about public 
education and our teachers and also targets our very vulnerable trans 
kids who are absolutely no threat to anyone in this body.
  Please understand that the provisions in this bill that out trans 
kids are cruel and dangerous. I say that as a mom of a trans kid. I was 
very embracing to my daughter when she came out, but not every family 
is. The reality is that 75 percent of trans kids experience 
discrimination and harassment.
  So why do Republicans want schools to require outing LGBTQ students?
  That does not make them better students.
  Congress has the constitutional authority to write laws. What a 
mockery and betrayal of that duty it would be to pass this stunt of a 
bill that doesn't address a single priority of parents, bans books, 
undermines teachers, and hurts our kids.
  Democrats are the party of parents and families. We reject this bill, 
and we commit to fighting for childcare, for universal pre-K, for a 
child tax credit, and for the ability of people to be free for who they 
are and express themselves.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two letters. One is from the 
National Education Association, and one is from the American Federation 
of Teachers.

                               National Education Association,

                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.
     U.S. House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 3 million members of 
     the National Education Association, dedicated and trusted 
     professionals who teach and support nearly 50 million 
     students in public schools across America, we urge you to 
     vote NO on H.R. 5. Votes related to this bill, including 
     extreme amendments that would create a national private 
     school voucher program, may be included in the NEA Report 
     Card for the 118th Congress.
       H.R. 5 is unnecessary and ignores the partnerships that 
     exist between parents and educators. Parents and guardians 
     already have the right and the opportunity to partner with 
     educators to ensure students have the learning opportunities, 
     resources, and support for success. Across America, parents 
     are strategizing with educators when children face hurdles 
     and celebrating with them when students achieve milestones, 
     volunteering at events, chaperoning field trips, leading 
     PTAs,",

                       PARENTS BILL OF RIGHTS ACT


                             General Leave

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 5.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 241 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 5.
  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Flood) to preside 
over the Committee of the Whole.

                              {time}  1420


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 5) to ensure the rights of parents are honored and protected in 
the Nation's public schools, with Mr. Flood in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the 
first time.
  General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 2 
hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce or their 
respective designees.
  The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Scott) each will control 1 hour.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today to recognize the profound importance of H.R. 
5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, and what it means for families 
across the country.
  Over the past several years, parents witnessed the consequences of 
lessons taught in classrooms firsthand. Math scores declined by the 
largest margin ever, and reading scores plummeted to the lowest levels 
in over three decades. These results are devastating.
  Teachers' unions and education bureaucrats worked to push progressive 
politics in classrooms while keeping parents in the dark. The Parents 
Bill of Rights Act aims to end that and shine a light on what is 
happening in schools. This bill will reaffirm a parent's right to 
review course curriculum, meet with the child's teacher, and be heard 
at school board meetings without fear of reprisal.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem convinced 
Republicans are using this bill to punish teachers or push an extreme 
rightwing agenda. This is false.
  Our education system is spiraling out of control as parents are 
pushed further outside the classroom. This bill will restore the role 
of parents in schools and provide new mechanisms to promote parent-
teacher partnerships.
  When parents are involved in their child's education, students 
thrive. That is the guiding principle of this bill. With the Parents 
Bill of Rights Act, Republicans will help parents steer the education 
of their children back onto the correct path where they can learn the 
skills they need for a lifetime of success.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the politics over parents 
act.
  First, let me be clear. House Democrats believe parental engagement 
is central to student success. Parental engagement in schools is 
closely linked to better student behavior, higher academic achievement, 
and enhanced social skills.
  Unfortunately, the politics over parents act does not take meaningful 
steps to increase or support parental engagement. In fact, it lists so-
called rights and then declares that this allows the parents to control 
what is taught. Let's be clear: There is nothing in the bill to give 
parents the right to dictate what their children are taught.
  Instead, this bill is one of many attempts by Republican politicians 
to give a vocal minority the power to try to impose their beliefs on 
all parents and students. This extreme education agenda has real 
consequences for students and educators.
  According to PEN America, over 2,500 books were banned in schools 
during the school year 2021-2022, and nearly 140 additional book bans 
have taken effect since July 2022.
  Let me just list some of the books that Republican politicians have 
gotten banned under the guise of parental rights: ``Diary of a Young 
Girl,'' the stories of a Holocaust survivor, by Anne Frank; ``The Kite 
Runner,'' a novel on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, by Khaled 
Hosseini; ``Beloved,'' a novel about slaves during the Civil War, by 
Toni Morrison; and on and on. Books like that have been banned because 
of efforts like what we have before us today.
  Let's be clear. These books are taught at age-appropriate levels. If 
you have a problem with it, you should call the librarian. Yet, 
Republican politicians are actually having them removed from classrooms 
and school libraries.
  Simply put, the politics over parents act is an educational gag order 
across the Nation which will prevent students from learning and prevent 
teachers from teaching. These efforts seek to score political points 
and scare parents into thinking that schools do not have their best 
interests at heart. Instead, we should be talking about the support 
that schools and families actually need to improve parent-teacher 
engagement.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the politics over 
parents act and join House Democrats in an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to deliver real solutions to build partnerships between 
schools and families.

  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Louisiana (Ms. Letlow).
  Ms. LETLOW. Mr. Chair, I rise today to join my voice with millions of 
American parents as the House considers H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of 
Rights Act.
  H.R. 5 is about one simple and fundamental principle: Parents should 
always have a seat at the table when it comes to their child's 
education.
  We believe that learning is a partnership between a family and their 
child's teachers. This bill is the vehicle by which we can put parents 
and educators together at the same table to have a productive dialogue.
  This bill is not complex or complicated, nor should it be partisan or 
polarizing. Contrary to what you may hear from my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, it is not an attack on our hardworking 
teachers, who will always be the heroes in my eyes. It is not an 
attempt to have Congress dictate the curriculum or determine the books 
in the library. Instead, this bill aims to bring more transparency and 
accountability to education, allowing parents to be informed and, when 
they have questions and concerns, to lawfully bring them to their local 
school boards.
  Over the past 2 years, we have seen too many instances where rather 
than opening their doors to welcome parents in as partners, some 
schools instead slammed them shut and said that government bureaucrats 
know what is best for our children.
  Parents across this country have overwhelmingly spoken out that they 
have had enough. They want a seat at the table because, at the end of 
the day, these are our children, not the government's.

[[Page H1349]]

  Mr. Chair, I worked in education before I came to Congress, and I am 
also a mom. I have seen firsthand how when you educate a child, you 
give them a future.
  We know that when parents are involved, it is the students who 
succeed. We also know that when a family is shut out of their child's 
education, it will lead to disastrous results.

                              {time}  1430

  Mr. Chair, let us give parents that voice in the learning process. 
Let schools open the doors and welcome them in as partners. Let us work 
together to build a brighter future for America's children.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), the ranking member on the Higher 
Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee.
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 
5. As an educator, I believe parent voices should be honored in 
schools. All educators believe this.
  We know that this bill is not about that at all. We have always had 
parents involved in our schools, so stop being foolish and divisive. We 
always need their input.
  This bill is nothing more than a talking point of the extreme MAGA 
agenda that will hurt children and hurt our schools. Let's face it--
there has been a movement to eliminate public education since the 1954 
Brown v. Board of Education decision.
  With the election of our President 7 years ago, it pulled the scab of 
a wound that never healed. Now it is an open, gaping wound, and it is 
out of control. They are throwing everything at public schools but the 
kitchen sink: vouchers, excessive testing, poorly paid teachers, 
banning books, and now they are trying to drive a wedge and create an 
antagonistic relationship between schools and their parents. How 
pathetic. How dreadful.
  Parents love teachers. Everybody loves teachers. Every parent has an 
``I love and remember a teacher'' story. How disgraceful that we want 
to terrorize the very people who love our children, keep them safe, and 
educate them for over 8 hours daily. Our teachers are sacrificial 
lambs.
  You will never eliminate public schools. We will fight you as long as 
it takes. This is all that the little children who look like me have. 
Public schools are the bedrock of this Nation.
  Let me tell you what a parent's bill of rights should include. I will 
call it the parents' 10 commandments:
  Thou shalt restore the Child Tax Credit; provide free, hot breakfast 
and lunch; provide free pre-K and free community college.
  Thou shalt end the school-to-prison pipeline; put a nurse in every 
school; offer after-school activities; provide intensive counseling 
services, particularly to address school shootings.
  Thou shalt offer parents the right to improve their education and job 
skills, love and respect every child's individuality, guarantee that 
every child's teacher will make a minimum of $60,000 a year.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Bean), chair of the Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary 
Education Subcommittee.
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Chair, should parents have the right to be 
involved in their child's education?
  That is the question before us. Seventy-two percent of Americans have 
answered ``yes'' to that question. Parents should be and want to be 
involved in their child's education.
  According to numerous studies, students who have involved parents 
have better behavior, better grades, better attendance, and develop a 
lifelong love of learning, which is the key to long-term success.
  Today, American parents are fed up, largely because they have 
experienced 2 years of school closures, misguided COVID policies, 
disastrous remote learning, and a curriculum focused on what is woke 
rather than what is essential academic instruction. They have been 
branded ``domestic terrorists'' for speaking out at school boards. Some 
were even arrested for having the nerve to plead with school boards 
about the safety of their child at school.
  Mr. Chair, it is time to re-welcome parents back into education. It 
is time for parents to have the right to know what is going on in 
American education today. That is why I--and I encourage everybody--to 
support H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, critical legislation 
that empowers parents and prioritizes the needs of students over 
entrenched special interest groups.
  Today, this body has an extraordinary opportunity to reclaim the 
moral high ground in America and usher in a newer era of K-12 education 
that empowers parents, protects kids, and expands educational freedom.
  American parents have said they want to be a part of their children's 
education. It is time for this body to say ``yes'' and support parents.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the ranking member of the Early 
Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction of the bill.
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 
5, which should be called the politics over parents act.
  After spending 15 years as a very involved public school parent, I 
can say without hesitation that I strongly support parental involvement 
in education. You won't meet a Member on this side of the aisle that 
disagrees with that. The bill before us today misses the mark.
  This could have been an opportunity to address the real challenges 
facing education, to make changes that would involve parents in a 
constructive way, and also make a positive difference in education. I 
am disappointed that we aren't doing that.
  House Democrats have shown time and time again that we are committed 
to providing all parents--including those who traditionally face 
barriers to engagement--with meaningful involvement in their kids' 
schools. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Democratic 
Party is the party of parental rights and family values.
  We have put forward a substantive plan that will actually increase 
the frequency, quality, and accessibility of parental involvement and 
engagement in schools; a substantive plan that invests in evidence-
based models and support systems that have been shown to increase 
family engagement and improve student achievement; a substantive plan 
that encourages parents to be partners, not adversaries, in their 
children's education; a substantive plan that roots out discrimination 
based on race, disability, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or 
gender identity in our public schools; a substantive plan that, unlike 
H.R. 5, doesn't carry dangerous, authoritarian undertones encouraging 
book bans, discouraging the teaching of scientifically and historically 
accurate curricula, and leading to the micromanagement of the work of 
educators.

  We welcome a conversation about how to empower parents, and urge our 
friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle to abandon their 
politically motivated attacks on schoolteachers and students. We should 
instead be working together on these issues in a bipartisan manner. Our 
Nation's students and families deserve that.
  We need more parents, including those from diverse backgrounds, to 
feel included, supported, engaged, and welcomed at their kids' school. 
This bill does not even begin to do that.
  I am leading more than 45 of our colleagues on a Bill of Rights for 
Students and Parents, a resolution that is supported by more than 250 
education, civil rights, and parents' groups, including the National 
PTA.
  I have heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that 
history will judge us on how we respond to the needs of students and 
families at this moment, and I agree with them.
  Will we succumb to an extremist, discriminatory, narrow-minded, anti-
public-education agenda, or will we work together to advance 
commonsense, meaningful policies that will support parents, students, 
and educators?
  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to take the approach that 
still sees public education as the great equalizer for all students 
regardless of who they are or where they are from, essential to our 
communities, the economy, and our democratic Republic.
  Please join me in rejecting this bill.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a statement from the National PTA 
in opposition to H.R. 5.


[[Page H1350]]


       Dear Representative Bobby Scott: National PTA and our 
     network of millions of parents and educators across the 
     country urge you to support adoption of the Bonamici 
     Substitute Amendment and oppose the underlying legislation, 
     H.R. 5, on the House Floor tomorrow.
       PTA opposes the underlying bill, H.R. 5, because it has the 
     potential to cause significant harm to children and families. 
     If passed as written, H.R. 5 could:
       Prevent mental health support for students in need;
       Limit access to learning-enhancing technology and 
     educational materials;
       Lead to inappropriate and harmful book bans and curriculum 
     censorship;
       Create confusion for school staff and burdensome opt-in 
     requirements for families;
       Impair relationships between educators and parents; and
       Undermine efforts to create safe, welcoming, supportive, 
     and inclusive learning environments for all students and 
     families.
       PTA supports Representative Bonamici's Substitute Amendment 
     to H.R. 5 as the ONLY PATH forward to ensuring supports and 
     services are in place for true family-school partnerships. We 
     stand behind our National Standards for Family-School 
     Partnerships that have been in place for over 20 years. The 
     Substitute Amendment provides the opportunity for meaningful 
     and inclusive family engagement in K-12 education and if 
     adopted would replace the current H.R. 5 and enable our 
     Nation's public schools to:
       Create a parent coordinator position in public schools;
       Reinforce existing parents' rights under federal law;
       Prohibit the federal government from curriculum censorship 
     and banning books; and
       Invest in full-service community schools and Statewide 
     Family Engagement Centers Program (the new authorization 
     level of $60 million would allow all states to participate).
       As the Nation's oldest and largest child advocacy 
     association, we know what meaningful family engagement looks 
     like and what parents want from their policymakers. We ask 
     you to join us in supporting the Bonamici Substitute 
     Amendment and opposing the underlying bill, H.R. 5 on the 
     House Floor. We thank you for consideration of this request 
     and if you have any questions, please reach out to our 
     Director of Government Affairs, Kate Clabaugh.

                         Parliamentary Inquiry

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Was the gentlewoman's request to introduce a 
statement recognized?
  The CHAIR. That request is covered under general leave.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the chair of the Agriculture Committee.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong 
support of the Parents Bill of Rights Act. This legislation is just one 
of many promises we intend to keep in our ``Commitment to America.''
  As a recovering school board member, I know firsthand the importance 
of hearing from parents and encouraging them to be engaged in their 
child's education.
  The Parents Bill of Rights Act provides parents an expanded 
opportunity to engage with their children and the teachers who educate 
them. This bill implements clear, commonsense protections allowing 
parents to easily review curriculum information, academic standards, 
and see how schools are spending our tax dollars.
  Parents deserve the right to be heard and should be able to raise 
concerns and address their school board without fear of harassment or 
retribution.
  This bill includes simple protections to keep our children safe, from 
protecting their privacy to requiring parents to be notified of violent 
activity in the school.
  As a graduate of the public school system and having raised three 
sons in the very same school district, I know parental involvement is 
critical to fostering a successful educational environment.
  Mr. Chair, quite simply, this bill is common sense. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation that ensures parents are at the 
center of their child's educational experience.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the 
Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
politics over parents act as a member of the Education and the 
Workforce Committee, as a member of the LGBTQ community, but above all, 
as a teacher.
  I am an educator and I know how important parental involvement is. 
All parents, including the parents of LGBTQ kids, have rights. They 
have rights to send their children to schools where they will be 
affirmed, protected, and free from harassment, and given the 
opportunity to thrive. They have a right to be free from bullying and 
humiliation.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from a million 
MomsRising.

                            [Mar. 21, 2023]

  So-Called `Parents Bill of Rights' Is All Wrong for America's Moms, 
 Families--A Toxic Plan That Will Create More Division, Damage to Our 
                          Kids and Communities

       Statement of Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, Executive Director 
     and CEO of MomsRising, the online and on-the-ground 
     organization of more than one million mothers and their 
     families, on the so-called `Parents Bill of Rights' (H.R. 5) 
     House Republicans are poised to pass this week:
       ``The badly misnamed `Parents Bill of Rights' the House GOP 
     plans to vote on this week is all wrong for America's moms, 
     kids, families, and educators. It is a recipe for censorship, 
     bullying and book bans, and for division based on race, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, masquerading as a 
     bill of rights. If it were to become law, the Parents Bill of 
     Rights would create more division by pitting educators 
     against parents. It would do enormous damage to our kids, 
     schools and communities.
       ``America's moms want schools to be safe and inclusive and 
     to value diversity; for parents to be respectful; and for 
     educators to be able to be honest about their identities and 
     allowed to teach our country's truths, good and bad, and the 
     values that got us to where we are today. We want our 
     children to learn about the history and obstacles faced, and 
     overcome, by members of our Black, Brown, AAPI, Native 
     American, immigrant, religious-minority, LGBTQ+, and other 
     communities. We want our students to be able to access 
     unbiased health information. We want all our youth, 
     regardless of income, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, 
     sexual orientation, and gender identity, to be safe and 
     included in schools that prepare them to contribute to and 
     succeed in our society.
       ``And we want a society that rejects `us vs. them' and puts 
     in place the caregiving and other supports that will allow 
     all families to succeed. MomsRising has more than a million 
     members and we have been working closely with moms in every 
     state for more than a decade. What this country's moms want 
     from Congress is affordable child, elder and disability care; 
     paid family and medical leave; fair pay; health care and 
     medications we can afford; vastly improved maternal health 
     care for all of us; the ability to make our own decisions 
     about if, when and how many children to have; and laws that 
     will end the scourge of gun violence and keep our children, 
     streets, schools and communities safe.
       ``Coming soon, we will release the Moms Rising for Freedom 
     Agenda with ten key policies lawmakers should support that 
     moms across the Nation really want, instead of the divisive 
     and harmful policies in the `Parents Bill of Rights.' That is 
     how we build a society in which we can all flourish and 
     thrive.''
  Mr. TAKANO. In committee, my Republican colleagues have preached 
about parents' God-given rights. I will tell you now that children have 
a God-given right not to be physically or emotionally harmed.
  As a teacher, I know of instances where children were outed by staff, 
and as a consequence those children faced severe punishment at home. 
One student was viciously beaten by his father and transferred out of a 
district after his family was informed that he was caught being 
physically affectionate with another boy.
  Imagine the situation in which educators are placed when government 
requires them to out their student to an unsupportive family. I will 
tell you what happens to those kids:
  73 percent of LGBTQ youth report anxiety.
  58 percent of them report depression.
  40 percent of homeless youth are LGBTQ, and
  46 percent, nearly half of them, have seriously considered suicide.
  Good teachers care about their kids. Good teachers know that a 
relationship with parents is important. But when a home is not safe for 
LGBTQ kids, school becomes their safe place, and teachers need to be 
their cheerleaders, not their first bullies.
  This bill forces good teachers to do bad things. It alienates 
students from their parents. It outs kids. It forces kids back into the 
closet. It is a fundamental invasion of privacy that puts children in 
danger.
  In the first 3 months that this Congress has been in session, this is 
what

[[Page H1351]]

Republicans have chosen to spend our time and taxpayer dollars on. The 
so-called Parents Bill of Rights Act is the exact type of Big 
Government overreach my colleagues across the aisle proclaim they are 
against, and puts the cost of their pursuit of political gain on the 
backs of students and teachers.
  This is worse than simply bad legislation. It is a concerted attack 
on children, parents, and teachers.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the bill.

                              {time}  1445

  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the 
Parents Bill of Rights Act. I thank Representative Letlow and Chair 
Foxx for their leadership in defending the God-given rights of parents 
and protecting kids as well.
  Parental involvement in their children's education is paramount to a 
student's success. However, in recent years, we have seen a push by 
some to exclude parents from their children's education. This is why I 
recently introduced the PROTECT Kids Act with Senator Tim Scott which 
has been included as an amendment to H.R. 5.
  The PROTECT Kids Act would require any Department of Education-funded 
elementary or middle school to seek and acquire parental consent before 
changing their child's pronouns or preferred name on any school form.
  This provision is straightforward, common sense, and will safeguard 
the critical relationship between parents, schools, and children.
  When a child goes on a field trip or fails a test, their parents are 
told and are often required to sign an acknowledgment or a permission 
slip.
  Why should relatively small things require notification but something 
as significant as a child's pronouns or a change in accommodations can 
be withheld from the people who raise and love them?
  Recent polling shows this has the broad support of the American 
people. Three-quarters of Americans believe schools should be required 
to obtain consent from parents.
  Parents have a fundamental right to raise and educate their children 
how they choose. We must pass the Parents Bill of Rights Act to help 
mitigate issues we have seen nationwide and to support parents who need 
the support to do right by their kids as well.
  On this side of the aisle, we believe this is the right way to go, 
and we believe that in the end it will promote education, family, and 
individualism as well.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is a member of the 
Committee on Education and the Workforce.
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, Congress should be supporting parents, 
students, and teachers, not advancing this politics over parents act 
which would punish teachers for giving history lessons, ban books, and 
sow hate and divisiveness against trans kids.
  Parents have the utmost confidence in their kids' teachers. When it 
comes to writing curricula, 76 percent of parents trust their child's 
school. But when it comes to writing laws, political gimmicks, like 
this bill, keep them from saying the same thing about this very body.
  Instead of manufacturing outrage over curricula and books, why don't 
we just listen?
  Mr. Chairman, 84 percent of parents would rather Congress give free 
school meals, and 79 percent want support for mental health services. 
In a survey of parents' top concerns by The Pew Charitable Trusts, 40 
percent said they were extremely or very worried about their children 
struggling with depression, 35 percent said they were concerned about 
bullying, and 22 percent were worried about their kids being shot.
  Not a single one of those issues on the top list of parental concerns 
is addressed in this bill. So don't tell me this is a parents' bill of 
rights. This is not addressing gun violence. It is not addressing 
mental health. It is not addressing childcare, pre-K, and all of the 
other things that would be a part of a parents' bill of rights.
  Instead, we are spending time on a bill that sows doubt about public 
education and our teachers and also targets our very vulnerable trans 
kids who are absolutely no threat to anyone in this body.
  Please understand that the provisions in this bill that out trans 
kids are cruel and dangerous. I say that as a mom of a trans kid. I was 
very embracing to my daughter when she came out, but not every family 
is. The reality is that 75 percent of trans kids experience 
discrimination and harassment.
  So why do Republicans want schools to require outing LGBTQ students?
  That does not make them better students.
  Congress has the constitutional authority to write laws. What a 
mockery and betrayal of that duty it would be to pass this stunt of a 
bill that doesn't address a single priority of parents, bans books, 
undermines teachers, and hurts our kids.
  Democrats are the party of parents and families. We reject this bill, 
and we commit to fighting for childcare, for universal pre-K, for a 
child tax credit, and for the ability of people to be free for who they 
are and express themselves.
  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two letters. One is from the 
National Education Association, and one is from the American Federation 
of Teachers.

                               National Education Association,

                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.
     U.S. House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 3 million members of 
     the National Education Association, dedicated and trusted 
     professionals who teach and support nearly 50 million 
     students in public schools across America, we urge you to 
     vote NO on H.R. 5. Votes related to this bill, including 
     extreme amendments that would create a national private 
     school voucher program, may be included in the NEA Report 
     Card for the 118th Congress.
       H.R. 5 is unnecessary and ignores the partnerships that 
     exist between parents and educators. Parents and guardians 
     already have the right and the opportunity to partner with 
     educators to ensure students have the learning opportunities, 
     resources, and support for success. Across America, parents 
     are strategizing with educators when children face hurdles 
     and celebrating with them when students achieve milestones, 
     volunteering at events, chaperoning field trips, leading 
     PTAs,",

     SEC. 6002. FINDINGS.

       Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) The dignity, freedom, and equality of all human beings 
     are fundamental to a thriving global community.
       (2) An alarming trend of violence directed at lesbian, gay, 
     bisexual, transgender, and intersex (commonly referred to as 
     ``LGBTI'') individuals around the world continues.
       (3) Approximately \1/3\ of all countries have laws 
     criminalizing consensual same-sex relations, and many have 
     enacted policies or laws that would further target LGBTI 
     individuals.
       (4) Every year, thousands of individuals around the world 
     are targeted for harassment, attack, arrest, and murder on 
     the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
       (5) Those who commit crimes against LGBTI individuals often 
     do so with impunity, and are not held accountable for their 
     crimes.
       (6) In many instances, police, prison, military, and 
     civilian government authorities have been directly complicit 
     in abuses aimed at LGBTI citizens, including arbitrary 
     arrest, torture, and sexual abuse.
       (7) Laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations 
     severely hinder access to HIV/AIDS treatment, information, 
     and preventive measures for LGBTI individuals and families.
       (8) Many countries are making positive developments in the 
     protection of the basic human rights of LGBTI individuals.

     governments of other countries, as appropriate, to impose 
     sanctions that are similar to the sanctions imposed under 
     this division.

     REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2023

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 495 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.
  Will the gentleman from Guam (Mr. Moylan) kindly resume the chair.

                              {time}  1218


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF AGENCY RULEMAKING.

       Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to 
     read as follows:

         ``CHAPTER 8--CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF AGENCY RULEMAKING

``Sec.
``801. Congressional review.
``802. Congressional approval procedure for major rules.
``803. Congressional disapproval procedure for nonmajor rules.
``804. Definitions.
``805. Judicial review.

  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):

     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF AGENCY RULEMAKING.

       (1) how many rules (as such term is defined in section 804

       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United 
     States shall submit a report to Congress that contains the 
     findings of the study conducted under subsection (a).

order except those printed in part A of House Report 118-108. Each such 
further amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the 
report, by the Member designated in the report, shall be considered as 
read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally 
divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be

                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Boebert

  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

     REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2023

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 495 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.
  Will the gentleman from Guam (Mr. Moylan) kindly resume the chair.

                              {time}  1218


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF AGENCY RULEMAKING.

                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Boebert

  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 495 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

     (A), each House shall provide copies of the report to the 
     chairman and ranking member of each standing committee with

     same rule may not be considered under this chapter in the 
     same Congress by either the House of Representatives or the 
     Senate.

     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United 
     States shall submit a report to Congress that contains the 
     findings of the study conducted under subsection (a).

  The CHAIR. No further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in 
order except those printed in part A of House Report 118-108. Each such 
further amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the 
report, by the Member designated in the report, shall be considered as 
read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally

                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Boebert

  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

     REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2023

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 495 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF AGENCY RULEMAKING.

       Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to

                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Boebert

  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

     REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2023

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 495 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF AGENCY RULEMAKING.

                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Boebert

  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 495 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

       ``(E) Budgetary effects of rules subject to section 802 of 
     title 5, united states code.--Any rule subject to the 
     congressional approval procedure set forth in section 802 of 
     chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, affecting budget

     section.''.

     SEC. 5. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE STUDY OF RULES.

       (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United 
     States shall conduct a study to determine, as of the date of 
     the enactment of this Act--
       (1) how many rules (as such term is defined in section 804 
     of title 5, United States Code) were in effect;
       (2) how many major rules (as such term is defined in 
     section 804 of title 5, United States Code) were in effect; 
     and
       (3) the total estimated economic cost imposed by all such 
     rules.
       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United 
     States shall submit a report to Congress that contains the 
     findings of the study conducted under subsection (a).

  The CHAIR. No further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in 
order except those printed in part A of House Report 118-108. Each such 
further amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the 
report, by the Member designated in the report, shall be considered as 
read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally 
divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be 
subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division 
of the question.


                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Boebert

  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

     REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2023

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 495 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF AGENCY RULEMAKING.

                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Boebert

  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

     REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2023

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 495 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Boebert

  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Boebert

  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF AGENCY RULEMAKING.

       Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to 
     read as follows:

       (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United 
     States shall conduct a study to determine, as of the date of 
     the enactment of this Act--
       (1) how many rules (as such term is defined in section 804 
     of title 5, United States Code) were in effect;
       (2) how many major rules (as such term is defined in 
     section 804 of title 5, United States Code) were in effect; 
     and
       (3) the total estimated economic cost imposed by all such 
     rules.
       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United 
     States shall submit a report to Congress that contains the 
     findings of the study conducted under subsection (a).

  The CHAIR. No further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in 
order except those printed in part A of House Report 118-108. Each such 
further amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the 
report, by the Member designated in the report, shall be considered as 
read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally 
divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be

                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Boebert

  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

     REGULATIONS FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN NEED OF SCRUTINY ACT OF 2023

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 495 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF AGENCY RULEMAKING.

                Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. Boebert

  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part A of House Report 118-108.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 3, line 21, strike ``and'' at the end.
       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):
       ``(iv) an estimate of the effect on inflation of the rule; 
     and''.

  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 495, the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 495 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 277.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 277) to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, 
to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force 
or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law, 
with Mr. Moylan in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, June 13, 
2023, all time for general debate pursuant to House Resolution 495 had 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on the Judiciary, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-6 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall 
be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment 
under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:

                                H.R. 277

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
                States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulations from the 
     Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2023'' or the ``REINS 
     Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for 
     and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 
     of article I of the United States Constitution grants all 
     legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has 
     excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing 
     to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability 
     for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in 
     Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted 
     and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and 
     a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
     American people for the laws imposed upon them.

       Page 3, insert after line 21 the following (and redesignate 
     provisions accordingly):

Colorado (Mrs. Boebert) and a Member opposed each will control 5

  Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in favor of amendment No. 1 as it revises the Comptroller 
General's congressional review report to include an estimate of the 
effect on inflation.
  Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's 
spending spree in the White House will not be taken into account by 
Congress as they perform their Article I duties. This will provide 
transparency for the administration to answer to the people's House.
  The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration 
accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's 
executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.
  Coloradans are struggling right now as they deal with the disastrous 
effects of Joe Biden's destructive economic policies. The policies 
passed last Congress unleashed record inflation on Americans, which has 
decimated our bank and retirement accounts, increased gas prices to 
record levels, raised utility bills, drove up grocery costs, and made 
it harder for Americans to live their lives as they intended.
  This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will 
pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year. Currently, 20 million 
Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We have seen a 4.3 percent 
decline in real wages since Biden took office. Americans have lost more 
than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Americans are paying more for 
everything because of leftwing extremist policies.
  My amendment will allow House Republicans to conduct important 
oversight over these expensive executive regulations to ensure Joe 
Biden cannot continue to issue rules that send America into a deeper 
inflation crisis.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment as 
well as the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an 
estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review 
report.
  I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's 
effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to 
speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little 
to do with the economy would affect inflation.
  The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to 
assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information 
available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports 
do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect 
even if they had the necessary information.

        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 583 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 2670.

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 2670) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2024 
for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military 
construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, 
to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for 
other purposes, with Mr. Stauber (Acting Chair) in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Thursday, 
July 13, 2023, amendment No. 62, printed in House Report 118-142 
offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Burlison), had been 
disposed of.


                 Amendment No. 63 Offered by Mr. Banks

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 63 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:
       At the end of subtitle G of title V, insert the following:

     SEC. 5__. PROHIBITION ON USE OF QUOTAS BASED ON RACE OR 
                   ETHNICITY IN SERVICE ACADEMY ADMISSIONS.

       None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act 
     or otherwise made available for the military service 
     academies for fiscal year 2024 may be used to discriminate or 
     to use quotas in admissions on the basis of race or 
     ethnicity.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. Banks) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the use of funds to 
discriminate on the basis of race and ethnicity in admissions to the 
military service academies.
  Currently, all of the military service academies use race and 
ethnicity as selection criteria for admissions. Not only is this a 
violation of the Constitution, as recently affirmed by the U.S. Supreme 
Court, but it is a violation of the military's longstanding 
meritocratic principles.
  The military service academies are elite universities that train and 
educate the future leaders of our armed services. We need the best and 
the brightest, the most fit cadets and midshipmen, regardless of their 
skin color and ethnicity. To consider immutable characteristics like 
race and ethnicity is blatantly discriminatory.
  For our national security, we must uphold the ideals of our country 
and put hard work, dedication, and service above all.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Washington is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, Mr. Banks' amendment to prohibit our Nation's service 
academies from promoting diverse experiences and backgrounds as part of 
its missions policy will do nothing but weaken our military.
  The Supreme Court recently recognized in its decision to leave 
service academies out of its ruling on affirmative action that our 
academies are not laboratories for ideological gerrymandering. They are 
institutions that are foundational to our national security.
  Our service academies are responsible for providing a higher 
education but also for training our Nation's men and women to serve as 
global leaders. Many graduates will serve in the highest levels of our 
military and government, where success depends on maintaining an open 
mind, building diverse coalitions, and drawing on broad experiences. 
They will lead as part of a military that has never been more diverse, 
more capable, or more lethal. Soon, nearly half of our servicemembers 
will be people of color, but only a fraction serve as officers and even 
a smaller fraction as senior leaders.
  We learned bitter and painful lessons in World War II, Korea, and 
Vietnam, when leaders neither understood nor looked like the formations 
they led.
  It is 2023, not 1952. If my colleagues across the aisle knew more 
about the painful history of this country, perhaps last night one of 
them would not have referred to Black servicemembers as ``colored 
people.''
  Let's not move our country backward. I oppose this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for 
introducing this amendment.
  I think it is a commonsense amendment. Right now, there are all sorts 
of rumors out there that when people are admitted to the service 
academies--who, after all, are going to wind up running our military, 
the one part of our government that cannot fail--preferences are being 
given and they are not always taking the best people that they can.
  I want to point out something that is a little bit offensive about 
this whole diversity thing. Diversity for people like the Democratic 
Party, sadly, is solely determined by your genetics or your DNA or 
where your ancestors were 200 years ago.
  I will give you an example to show the foolishness of it and that the 
real goal here, I think, is to divide Americans.
  If I am one-quarter Peruvian, I can identify as Hispanic. I can 
identify as Hispanic despite the fact I have never spoken a word of 
Spanish and never been south of the border in my life. The people who 
just want to divide America would say that I have a unique perspective 
growing up in a Milwaukee suburb, despite the fact that I am one-
quarter from a different part of the world.
  This is preposterous on its face, and it will inevitably lead to 
division as we are educating our military that they should look at 
people by where their ancestors came from, not as individuals.
  This true racism, which is what it absolutely is because that is how 
they determine which silo you fit into, has to be ripped away from our 
society and the military, in particular.
  The idea that we have different viewpoints because of where our 
ancestors came from despite the fact that we have not been there and 
know nothing of them is preposterous.
  Like I said, in addition to the divisiveness, you are going to wind 
up with people who are not necessarily the best people to lead our 
military. Anybody familiar with military history knows the important 
decisions that have to be made during wartime. We want those decisions 
made by the brightest people we have, not by people who have been 
picked based upon where their DNA was 2,000 years ago.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Kim), the ranking member

[[Page H3582]]

of the Military Personnel Subcommittee.
  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Chair, I want to respond to what was just 
said.
  It is absolutely important that we set straight that diversity does 
not mean we are talking about people who are less qualified. We are not 
talking about reducing standards. We are talking about recognizing one 
part of the decision as one part of many.
  This is not a situation where it is the overriding factor. I agree 
with what Chairman Banks said, which is that we want the best and 
brightest, but what we recognize when it comes to our service 
academies, in particular, is that this is a situation where we are 
trying to also build a force.

  This is not just about an individual. Yes, we want the best and 
brightest, but we also want the most cohesive and effective fighting 
force for our country.
  We recognize we are building an entity where our servicemembers are 
part of something bigger than all of them.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from New Jersey.
  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. I think about this brief that was put forward 
to the Supreme Court that was written by former military officials that 
said: ``The importance of maintaining a diverse, highly qualified 
officer corps has been beyond legitimate dispute for decades. History 
has shown that placing a diverse Armed Forces under the command of 
homogenous leadership is a recipe for internal resentment, discord, and 
violence.''
  This is written by former military leaders who are advising us to 
make sure that we let the military be able to control and be able to 
have the tools they need to build a force that our country needs.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Mast), a real American hero.
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Chair, I am amazed at the bigoted comments I am hearing 
from the other side right now, literally stating that units need to 
look a certain way. There have to be people of certain colors in these 
units. It is purely idiotic. It is dangerous.
  War is not a game. It is always dangerous. It is very often deadly. I 
damn near gave my life for this country, and I can tell you the last 
thing I cared about was the color of the snipers that had my back or 
the color of the medics that were putting tourniquets on each of my 
legs and my left arm when I was injured on the battlefield. It didn't 
matter if they were Black, White, Brown.
  None of that mattered when they were recruited into the military, and 
it didn't matter as they were serving. It has absolutely zero place, 
and you are literally putting the lives of our servicemembers in 
danger. You are concretely saying that units need to look a certain way 
by color.
  I just pose this quick question. I don't know how much time I have 
remaining, but I will bet you all over there can't tell me what my 
background is. Am I part Black? Part Brown? Part White? What am I?
  I yield time to you for a colloquy if you want to answer that. What 
am I?
  The Acting CHAIR. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the 
Chair.
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Chair, I will bet they can't tell me. I hear silence 
because you don't know what I am. You don't know that I am half 
Mexican. You can't look at me and see that, but you believe that units 
should be made up of something that you can't see and that you can't 
ask about. It is idiotic policy and dangerous for our servicemembers, 
and they deserve better from the other side.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would again remind Members to direct 
their remarks to the Chair.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Ryan), vice ranking member of the House Armed Services 
Committee.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for his service.
  Mr. Chair, I rise as a proud graduate of the United States Military 
Academy at West Point and a representative of the academy today. 
Whether my colleagues want to recognize it or not, particularly those 
on the far right, we have an increasingly growing diverse force.
  As Mr. Kim said, unit cohesion, we can all agree, is essential and 
critical, both in the heat of battle and in training and preparation. 
This amendment would unequivocally, as you heard from retired military 
officers across the world, weaken unit cohesion. Even the 
considerably--to be generous--conservative Supreme Court has recognized 
the distinct interests of these service academies in the Court's recent 
decision that came down just a few weeks ago.
  We have made great strides at the academies with a focus and 
bipartisan commitment for decades. West Point has gone from 20 percent 
to 36 percent cadets of minority backgrounds, and the Naval Academy 
from 19 percent to 37 percent, but we still have work to do to achieve 
unit cohesion.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple. It ensures our 
military service academies are in line with the Supreme Court's recent 
decision on the unconstitutionality of race-based affirmative action, 
and it strives to uphold the ideals of meritocracy, which is nowhere 
more important than in the United States military.
  Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time remaining.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1 minute remaining.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Chair, today's military leaders are unequivocal in their support 
of diversity and leadership. Joint Chiefs Chairman Milley considers it 
fundamental. Army Chief McConville calls it a crucial competitive 
advantage. Then-Air Force Chief CQ Brown called diversity an 
imperative. Marine Corps Commandant Berger said the core of America's 
strength lies in its diversity.
  The very government assembled here today, in its amicus brief to the 
Supreme Court, characterized a diverse pool of academy graduates as a 
vital interest on which the Nation's future depends.
  The American people expect and demand that our academies are given 
every tool and advantage to train leaders capable of fighting and 
winning our Nation's wars. Make no mistake, diversity is not synonymous 
with less qualified. We want the best. We want the brightest. We need 
the most diverse.

  This amendment attempts to weaken a concept foundational to our 
current and future military supremacy, that diversity translates into 
capability and lethality.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will 
be postponed.

                  Amendment No. 64 Offered by Mr. Roy

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 64 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of subtitle E of title X, insert the following:

     SEC. 10__. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN 
                   EXECUTIVE ORDERS.

       (1) Executive Order 13990, relating to Protecting Public 
     Health and the Environment and Restoring Science To Tackle

     Reduction Act of 2022.
       (7) Executive Order 14096, relating to Revitalizing Our 
     Nation's Commitment to Environmental Justice for All.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Roy) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, we have spent the better part of the last several 
days making clear to the American people that this side of the aisle 
wants to see a Department of Defense that is focused on its core 
mission, defending the United States of America, rather than divvying 
us up by race and dividing us and separating us.
  I rise today to ensure that the Department of Defense is focused on 
its core mission rather than pursuing the political agenda of climate 
change to the detriment of the national security of the United States.
  In 2021, Department of Defense spokesman John Kirby refused to say 
that China is a bigger national security threat to the United States 
than climate change. He called them equally important and said it 
doesn't do any good to make a relative assessment of national security 
issues.
  Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said climate change is an 
existential threat to our Nation's security.
  Next week, Secretary of State John Kerry literally travels to China 
to discuss climate change, not China's increased aggression against 
Taiwan, not its expansion in the Pacific, not its oppression of its 
people, not the fact that they produce two new coal-fired plants per 
week on top of the 1,100 they have while we undermine our national 
security to pursue the climate-fetish agenda of the other side of the 
aisle.
  President Biden's executive orders have served as the catalyst for 
massive reforms at the Department of Defense that compromise national 
security to advance this climate fetish.
  The amendment that I offer would prohibit any of the funding in the 
National Defense Authorization Act, or that flows from that 
authorization, from being used to carry out President Biden's executive 
orders on climate change.
  The Department of Defense's climate adaptation plan includes radical 
proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the expense of our 
warfighting capabilities. According to the plan, the DOD has identified 
climate change as a critical national security issue. It mandates 
environmental justice because why miss an opportunity to push divisive 
ideology?
  The DOD says it will transition to 100 percent carbon-free 
electricity, meaning America's war machine will literally depend on the 
wind and the sun.
  No one, including anyone on this side of the aisle, believes that we 
shouldn't pursue every advantage and technology to harness energy, no 
one. In Texas, we have embraced wind and we have embraced solar, but to 
our detriment when we have interfered with the market and interfered 
with our ability to have energy at our disposal and at our demand. We 
undermine our grid. We undermine our national security. We undermine 
reliability. We cause energy prices to go up.
  In this case, in the context of the National Defense Authorization 
Act, we should not be pursuing this politically motivated climate 
fetishization that undermines our national security.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Three quick points here. First of all, it is interesting. You can go 
back to 2008 and look at John McCain's campaign and, entertainingly, 
Sarah Palin's Vice Presidential statements about how climate change was 
an existential threat, and this was a bipartisan issue where we talked 
about why this was a significant challenge that we needed to address.
  Then, of course, Barack Obama had the audacity to get elected 
President and pursue that agenda, so suddenly it became political.
  I just want to make this very, very clear. The belief here is that 
digging up fossil fuels from below the ground and burning them is bad 
for life, it is bad for the planet, and it will eventually exterminate 
the planet.
  Now, if you want to disagree with that, you want to have a little 
argument about whether or not that is true, we can. I mean, the 
overwhelming majority of scientists seem to agree with that, but let's 
hear the argument. It just kills me to sit here and listen to the other 
side claim that this is a political agenda.
  Now, I understand why they do that, because that skips past the messy 
part of where you have to actually argue the facts and you can just 
dismiss it as politics and everyone robotically goes: Oh, yes, 
politics, that is bad. We can't have that.
  If we can have an actual discussion about this, if you believe, as 
the administration does and as, again, I don't know, 80 percent of the 
scientists believe, that climate change could destroy the fricking 
planet, then it is worth saying that that's a national security threat 
at least equivalent to China.
  Yes, there is the possibility of global nuclear war with China that 
could exterminate the planet, but climate change, the argument is, 
would exterminate the planet, so I think that is worth thinking about.
  Please believe me when I say this is not a political agenda. It is a 
heartfelt belief that we have a distinct problem here that needs to be 
addressed.
  Second: How to address it. Come up with alternative sources of energy 
and make those investments. This is also very important, because even 
if this wasn't destroying the planet, our dependency upon oil has been 
problematic.
  I know there is this fantasy that we are going to become energy 
independent. Nobody is energy independent. Oil is a global marketplace. 
Even if we generate enough energy, we sell it overseas, and Saudi 
Arabia and OPEC therefore have an enormous amount of control over that 
market.
  As I have said over and over again, the true answer to this problem 
is, when gas prices go up, wouldn't it be great to say: That is 
wonderful, but we don't need that, we have other sources of energy to 
go to. Nothing is more important in the military than energy and access 
to it. Wars are started over having access to the energy that you need. 
To say that this doesn't involve national security literally hurts my 
brain. You need these alternatives.
  The last argument is on the market: We will let the market decide. 
The market subsidized the living hell out of the oil industry for 175 
years. They have an enormous advantage. The pipelines, the system, the 
entire thing that was built, was built on our taxpayer dollars. Now, 
what we are saying is if we are going to develop an alternative to 
that, then we are going to have to help that, as we helped nuclear 
energy, and a whole of bunch other different things.
  I don't think I hear the other side complaining about the government 
subsidizing nuclear energy because that fits within their politics.
  If I ask nothing else, could we please just have a rational 
discussion that understands that this is a legitimate policy issue? It 
isn't a fetish. It isn't a political debate. It is the fate of the 
planet and how we manage energy policy, both of which--I am going to 
take a real bold step here--actually impact national security. I 
believe that they do, and I believe that anybody would agree with that 
statement.
  Please, defeat this amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague for basically making 
the case for the very climate fetish that I describe. When he talks 
about the need for energy and its existence for national security, my 
point is having reliable energy. We have to have energy that is 
available and reliable and dependable. That is the whole point.
  My colleague talks about nuclear power. Great. I am waiting with 
bated breath for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to 
embrace and promote and push noncarbon-producing nuclear power.
  We haven't generated a new nuclear power plant since when, the 1970s?

[[Page H3584]]

Georgia isn't even off the ground because of Federal regulation and 
interference.
  The fact is, we are subsidizing and promoting unreliable wind and 
solar while subsidizing the hell out of electric vehicles, and my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to use the Defense 
Department to continue to promote it, when it engaged in crony 
capitalism to enrich a small handful of elitists on the back of the 
hardworking American people while we subsidize China and make ourselves 
reliable on China for their minerals and what they produce.
  It is absolutely astonishing that we would turn over our national 
defense capability to China at this point in time to pursue this 
radical agenda.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I would just note that we 
actually are making investments in nuclear power. It is really 
expensive and difficult to develop, but the investments are being made. 
That is part of the agenda.
  Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Garamendi).
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I am actually quite amazed that we are 
allowing a political ideology to get in the way of reality and facts.
  The fact of the matter is that the U.S. military, more than a decade 
ago, noticed that the climate was changing and they needed to address 
it. Also, the fact is that the largest solar and wind energy systems in 
the Nation are in Texas, and Texas is dependent upon those for their 
power when a heat wave arrives.
  Let's be smart here. Let's not let ideology and the fact that we want 
to get into a fight over climate change get in the way of good public 
policy. It is absolutely essential that the military build for the 
future, that they build for resiliency.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will 
be postponed.
  The Chair understands that amendment No. 65 will not be offered.


                Amendment No. 66 Offered by Mr. Davidson

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 66 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of subtitle D of title XVI, insert the 
     following:

     SEC. 16__. EXCLUSIVE MEANS FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE TO 
                   ACQUIRE LOCATION INFORMATION, WEB BROWSING 
                   HISTORY, INTERNET SEARCH HISTORY, AND FOURTH 
                   AMENDMENT-PROTECTED INFORMATION.

       (a) Exclusive Means.--
       (1) Foreign intelligence purposes.--Title I and sections 
     303, 304, 703, 704, and 705 of the Foreign Intelligence 
     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., 1823, 1824, 
     1881b, 1881c, 1881d) shall be the exclusive means by which 
     the Secretary of Defense acquires location information, web 
     browsing history, Internet search history, and Fourth 
     Amendment-protected information of United States persons or 
     persons inside the United States for foreign intelligence 
     purposes.
       (2) Law enforcement purposes.--A warrant obtained by 
     demonstrating probable cause shall be the exclusive means by

     Amendment-protected information of United States persons or 
     persons inside the United States for law enforcement 
     purposes.
       (b) Third Party.--If the interception, or compelled 
     production, or physical search or seizure of information 
     inside the United States by the Secretary of Defense would 
     require a warrant, court order, or subpoena under law, the 
     Secretary may not obtain that information from a third party 
     in exchange for anything of value without obtaining the 
     warrant, court order, or subpoena that would be required for 
     such interception, compelled production, or physical search 
     or seizure.
       (c) Exception.--Notwithstanding subsection (b), the 
     Secretary of Defense may acquire the types of information

     of such an agency or element.
       (d) Definitions.--In this section:
       (1) The term ``Fourth Amendment-protected information'' 
     means information the compelled production of which would 
     require a warrant for law enforcement purposes.
       (2) The term ``location information'' means information 
     derived or otherwise calculated from the transmission or 
     reception of a radio signal that reveals the approximate or 
     actual geographic location of a customer, subscriber, or 
     device.
       (3) The term ``United States person'' has the meaning given 
     that term in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence 
     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801).

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. Davidson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chair, the amendment I have offered would prevent 
the Department of Defense from purchasing data that would otherwise 
require a warrant, court order, or subpoena. The amendment would also 
end unauthorized surveillance practices.
  The government is currently circumventing the Fourth Amendment by 
purchasing location data, internet browsing data, and other sensitive 
information. The so-called data broker loophole is a severe threat to 
the right to privacy in the United States.
  Freedom surrendered is rarely reclaimed, but we must defend our 
Fourth Amendment.
  Government surveillance programs are routinely misused and targeted 
at Americans. The FBI, in fact, admits it conducted 278,000 improper 
searches of American citizens in 2020 alone. If the government can buy 
its way around the Fourth Amendment, there will be few meaningful 
limits on government surveillance.
  We need to pass this amendment. It at least stops the Department of 
Defense from doing that inside the United States of America.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Alabama?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering 
the amendment.
  Ubiquitous commercial data collection and bulk data sales represent a 
privacy concern for all Americans. Companies and governments alike have 
access to once unimaginable amounts of user data through commercial 
channels. This development and the Fourth Amendment questions that come 
with it deserve full consideration.
  I look forward to working with the gentleman on this amendment to 
ensure that these issues are addressed in a manner that does not unduly 
burden the Department of Defense relative to the rest of the Federal 
Government while ensuring its operational needs are met.
  I think Congress will spend a substantial amount of time on the 
privacy concerns addressed by this amendment in the coming months, and ",

                 Amendment No. 63 Offered by Mr. Banks

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 63 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:
       At the end of subtitle G of title V, insert the following:

     SEC. 5__. PROHIBITION ON USE OF QUOTAS BASED ON RACE OR 
                   ETHNICITY IN SERVICE ACADEMY ADMISSIONS.

       None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act 
     or otherwise made available for the military service 
     academies for fiscal year 2024 may be used to discriminate or 
     to use quotas in admissions on the basis of race or 
     ethnicity.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. Banks) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the use of funds to 
discriminate on the basis of race and ethnicity in admissions to the 
military service academies.
  Currently, all of the military service academies use race and 
ethnicity as selection criteria for admissions. Not only is this a 
violation of the Constitution, as recently affirmed by the U.S. Supreme 
Court, but it is a violation of the military's longstanding 
meritocratic principles.
  The military service academies are elite universities that train and 
educate the future leaders of our armed services. We need the best and 
the brightest, the most fit cadets and midshipmen, regardless of their 
skin color and ethnicity. To consider immutable characteristics like 
race and ethnicity is blatantly discriminatory.
  For our national security, we must uphold the ideals of our country 
and put hard work, dedication, and service above all.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Washington is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, Mr. Banks' amendment to prohibit our Nation's service 
academies from promoting diverse experiences and backgrounds as part of 
its missions policy will do nothing but weaken our military.
  The Supreme Court recently recognized in its decision to leave 
service academies out of its ruling on affirmative action that our 
academies are not laboratories for ideological gerrymandering. They are 
institutions that are foundational to our national security.
  Our service academies are responsible for providing a higher 
education but also for training our Nation's men and women to serve as 
global leaders. Many graduates will serve in the highest levels of our 
military and government, where success depends on maintaining an open 
mind, building diverse coalitions, and drawing on broad experiences. 
They will lead as part of a military that has never been more diverse, 
more capable, or more lethal. Soon, nearly half of our servicemembers 
will be people of color, but only a fraction serve as officers and even 
a smaller fraction as senior leaders.
  We learned bitter and painful lessons in World War II, Korea, and 
Vietnam, when leaders neither understood nor looked like the formations 
they led.
  It is 2023, not 1952. If my colleagues across the aisle knew more 
about the painful history of this country, perhaps last night one of 
them would not have referred to Black servicemembers as ``colored 
people.''
  Let's not move our country backward. I oppose this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for 
introducing this amendment.
  I think it is a commonsense amendment. Right now, there are all sorts 
of rumors out there that when people are admitted to the service 
academies--who, after all, are going to wind up running our military, 
the one part of our government that cannot fail--preferences are being 
given and they are not always taking the best people that they can.
  I want to point out something that is a little bit offensive about 
this whole diversity thing. Diversity for people like the Democratic 
Party, sadly, is solely determined by your genetics or your DNA or 
where your ancestors were 200 years ago.
  I will give you an example to show the foolishness of it and that the 
real goal here, I think, is to divide Americans.
  If I am one-quarter Peruvian, I can identify as Hispanic. I can 
identify as Hispanic despite the fact I have never spoken a word of 
Spanish and never been south of the border in my life. The people who 
just want to divide America would say that I have a unique perspective 
growing up in a Milwaukee suburb, despite the fact that I am one-
quarter from a different part of the world.
  This is preposterous on its face, and it will inevitably lead to 
division as we are educating our military that they should look at 
people by where their ancestors came from, not as individuals.
  This true racism, which is what it absolutely is because that is how 
they determine which silo you fit into, has to be ripped away from our 
society and the military, in particular.
  The idea that we have different viewpoints because of where our 
ancestors came from despite the fact that we have not been there and 
know nothing of them is preposterous.
  Like I said, in addition to the divisiveness, you are going to wind 
up with people who are not necessarily the best people to lead our 
military. Anybody familiar with military history knows the important 
decisions that have to be made during wartime. We want those decisions 
made by the brightest people we have, not by people who have been 
picked based upon where their DNA was 2,000 years ago.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Kim), the ranking member

[[Page H3582]]

of the Military Personnel Subcommittee.
  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Chair, I want to respond to what was just 
said.
  It is absolutely important that we set straight that diversity does 
not mean we are talking about people who are less qualified. We are not 
talking about reducing standards. We are talking about recognizing one 
part of the decision as one part of many.
  This is not a situation where it is the overriding factor. I agree 
with what Chairman Banks said, which is that we want the best and 
brightest, but what we recognize when it comes to our service 
academies, in particular, is that this is a situation where we are 
trying to also build a force.

  This is not just about an individual. Yes, we want the best and 
brightest, but we also want the most cohesive and effective fighting 
force for our country.
  We recognize we are building an entity where our servicemembers are 
part of something bigger than all of them.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from New Jersey.
  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. I think about this brief that was put forward 
to the Supreme Court that was written by former military officials that 
said: ``The importance of maintaining a diverse, highly qualified 
officer corps has been beyond legitimate dispute for decades. History 
has shown that placing a diverse Armed Forces under the command of 
homogenous leadership is a recipe for internal resentment, discord, and 
violence.''
  This is written by former military leaders who are advising us to 
make sure that we let the military be able to control and be able to 
have the tools they need to build a force that our country needs.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Mast), a real American hero.
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Chair, I am amazed at the bigoted comments I am hearing 
from the other side right now, literally stating that units need to 
look a certain way. There have to be people of certain colors in these 
units. It is purely idiotic. It is dangerous.
  War is not a game. It is always dangerous. It is very often deadly. I 
damn near gave my life for this country, and I can tell you the last 
thing I cared about was the color of the snipers that had my back or 
the color of the medics that were putting tourniquets on each of my 
legs and my left arm when I was injured on the battlefield. It didn't 
matter if they were Black, White, Brown.
  None of that mattered when they were recruited into the military, and 
it didn't matter as they were serving. It has absolutely zero place, 
and you are literally putting the lives of our servicemembers in 
danger. You are concretely saying that units need to look a certain way 
by color.
  I just pose this quick question. I don't know how much time I have 
remaining, but I will bet you all over there can't tell me what my 
background is. Am I part Black? Part Brown? Part White? What am I?
  I yield time to you for a colloquy if you want to answer that. What 
am I?
  The Acting CHAIR. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the 
Chair.
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Chair, I will bet they can't tell me. I hear silence 
because you don't know what I am. You don't know that I am half 
Mexican. You can't look at me and see that, but you believe that units 
should be made up of something that you can't see and that you can't 
ask about. It is idiotic policy and dangerous for our servicemembers, 
and they deserve better from the other side.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would again remind Members to direct 
their remarks to the Chair.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Ryan), vice ranking member of the House Armed Services 
Committee.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for his service.
  Mr. Chair, I rise as a proud graduate of the United States Military 
Academy at West Point and a representative of the academy today. 
Whether my colleagues want to recognize it or not, particularly those 
on the far right, we have an increasingly growing diverse force.
  As Mr. Kim said, unit cohesion, we can all agree, is essential and 
critical, both in the heat of battle and in training and preparation. 
This amendment would unequivocally, as you heard from retired military 
officers across the world, weaken unit cohesion. Even the 
considerably--to be generous--conservative Supreme Court has recognized 
the distinct interests of these service academies in the Court's recent 
decision that came down just a few weeks ago.
  We have made great strides at the academies with a focus and 
bipartisan commitment for decades. West Point has gone from 20 percent 
to 36 percent cadets of minority backgrounds, and the Naval Academy 
from 19 percent to 37 percent, but we still have work to do to achieve 
unit cohesion.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple. It ensures our 
military service academies are in line with the Supreme Court's recent 
decision on the unconstitutionality of race-based affirmative action, 
and it strives to uphold the ideals of meritocracy, which is nowhere 
more important than in the United States military.
  Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time remaining.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1 minute remaining.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Chair, today's military leaders are unequivocal in their support 
of diversity and leadership. Joint Chiefs Chairman Milley considers it 
fundamental. Army Chief McConville calls it a crucial competitive 
advantage. Then-Air Force Chief CQ Brown called diversity an 
imperative. Marine Corps Commandant Berger said the core of America's 
strength lies in its diversity.
  The very government assembled here today, in its amicus brief to the 
Supreme Court, characterized a diverse pool of academy graduates as a 
vital interest on which the Nation's future depends.
  The American people expect and demand that our academies are given 
every tool and advantage to train leaders capable of fighting and 
winning our Nation's wars. Make no mistake, diversity is not synonymous 
with less qualified. We want the best. We want the brightest. We need 
the most diverse.

  This amendment attempts to weaken a concept foundational to our 
current and future military supremacy, that diversity translates into 
capability and lethality.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will 
be postponed.

                  Amendment No. 64 Offered by Mr. Roy

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 64 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of subtitle E of title X, insert the following:

     SEC. 10__. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN

     Nation's Commitment to Environmental Justice for All.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Roy) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, we have spent the better part of the last several 
days making clear to the American people that this side of the aisle 
wants to see a Department of Defense that is focused on its core 
mission, defending the United States of America, rather than divvying 
us up by race and dividing us and separating us.
  I rise today to ensure that the Department of Defense is focused on 
its core mission rather than pursuing the political agenda of climate 
change to the detriment of the national security of the United States.
  In 2021, Department of Defense spokesman John Kirby refused to say 
that China is a bigger national security threat to the United States 
than climate change. He called them equally important and said it 
doesn't do any good to make a relative assessment of national security 
issues.
  Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said climate change is an 
existential threat to our Nation's security.
  Next week, Secretary of State John Kerry literally travels to China 
to discuss climate change, not China's increased aggression against 
Taiwan, not its expansion in the Pacific, not its oppression of its 
people, not the fact that they produce two new coal-fired plants per 
week on top of the 1,100 they have while we undermine our national 
security to pursue the climate-fetish agenda of the other side of the 
aisle.
  President Biden's executive orders have served as the catalyst for 
massive reforms at the Department of Defense that compromise national 
security to advance this climate fetish.
  The amendment that I offer would prohibit any of the funding in the 
National Defense Authorization Act, or that flows from that 
authorization, from being used to carry out President Biden's executive 
orders on climate change.
  The Department of Defense's climate adaptation plan includes radical 
proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the expense of our 
warfighting capabilities. According to the plan, the DOD has identified 
climate change as a critical national security issue. It mandates 
environmental justice because why miss an opportunity to push divisive 
ideology?
  The DOD says it will transition to 100 percent carbon-free 
electricity, meaning America's war machine will literally depend on the 
wind and the sun.
  No one, including anyone on this side of the aisle, believes that we 
shouldn't pursue every advantage and technology to harness energy, no 
one. In Texas, we have embraced wind and we have embraced solar, but to 
our detriment when we have interfered with the market and interfered 
with our ability to have energy at our disposal and at our demand. We 
undermine our grid. We undermine our national security. We undermine 
reliability. We cause energy prices to go up.
  In this case, in the context of the National Defense Authorization 
Act, we should not be pursuing this politically motivated climate 
fetishization that undermines our national security.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Three quick points here. First of all, it is interesting. You can go 
back to 2008 and look at John McCain's campaign and, entertainingly, 
Sarah Palin's Vice Presidential statements about how climate change was 
an existential threat, and this was a bipartisan issue where we talked 
about why this was a significant challenge that we needed to address.
  Then, of course, Barack Obama had the audacity to get elected 
President and pursue that agenda, so suddenly it became political.
  I just want to make this very, very clear. The belief here is that 
digging up fossil fuels from below the ground and burning them is bad 
for life, it is bad for the planet, and it will eventually exterminate 
the planet.
  Now, if you want to disagree with that, you want to have a little 
argument about whether or not that is true, we can. I mean, the 
overwhelming majority of scientists seem to agree with that, but let's 
hear the argument. It just kills me to sit here and listen to the other 
side claim that this is a political agenda.
  Now, I understand why they do that, because that skips past the messy 
part of where you have to actually argue the facts and you can just 
dismiss it as politics and everyone robotically goes: Oh, yes, 
politics, that is bad. We can't have that.
  If we can have an actual discussion about this, if you believe, as 
the administration does and as, again, I don't know, 80 percent of the 
scientists believe, that climate change could destroy the fricking 
planet, then it is worth saying that that's a national security threat 
at least equivalent to China.
  Yes, there is the possibility of global nuclear war with China that 
could exterminate the planet, but climate change, the argument is, 
would exterminate the planet, so I think that is worth thinking about.
  Please believe me when I say this is not a political agenda. It is a 
heartfelt belief that we have a distinct problem here that needs to be 
addressed.
  Second: How to address it. Come up with alternative sources of energy 
and make those investments. This is also very important, because even 
if this wasn't destroying the planet, our dependency upon oil has been 
problematic.
  I know there is this fantasy that we are going to become energy 
independent. Nobody is energy independent. Oil is a global marketplace. 
Even if we generate enough energy, we sell it overseas, and Saudi 
Arabia and OPEC therefore have an enormous amount of control over that 
market.
  As I have said over and over again, the true answer to this problem 
is, when gas prices go up, wouldn't it be great to say: That is 
wonderful, but we don't need that, we have other sources of energy to 
go to. Nothing is more important in the military than energy and access 
to it. Wars are started over having access to the energy that you need. 
To say that this doesn't involve national security literally hurts my 
brain. You need these alternatives.
  The last argument is on the market: We will let the market decide. 
The market subsidized the living hell out of the oil industry for 175 
years. They have an enormous advantage. The pipelines, the system, the 
entire thing that was built, was built on our taxpayer dollars. Now, 
what we are saying is if we are going to develop an alternative to 
that, then we are going to have to help that, as we helped nuclear 
energy, and a whole of bunch other different things.
  I don't think I hear the other side complaining about the government 
subsidizing nuclear energy because that fits within their politics.
  If I ask nothing else, could we please just have a rational 
discussion that understands that this is a legitimate policy issue? It 
isn't a fetish. It isn't a political debate. It is the fate of the 
planet and how we manage energy policy, both of which--I am going to 
take a real bold step here--actually impact national security. I 
believe that they do, and I believe that anybody would agree with that 
statement.
  Please, defeat this amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague for basically making 
the case for the very climate fetish that I describe. When he talks 
about the need for energy and its existence for national security, my 
point is having reliable energy. We have to have energy that is 
available and reliable and dependable. That is the whole point.
  My colleague talks about nuclear power. Great. I am waiting with 
bated breath for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to 
embrace and promote and push noncarbon-producing nuclear power.
  We haven't generated a new nuclear power plant since when, the 1970s?

[[Page H3584]]

Georgia isn't even off the ground because of Federal regulation and 
interference.
  The fact is, we are subsidizing and promoting unreliable wind and 
solar while subsidizing the hell out of electric vehicles, and my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to use the Defense 
Department to continue to promote it, when it engaged in crony 
capitalism to enrich a small handful of elitists on the back of the 
hardworking American people while we subsidize China and make ourselves 
reliable on China for their minerals and what they produce.
  It is absolutely astonishing that we would turn over our national 
defense capability to China at this point in time to pursue this 
radical agenda.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I would just note that we 
actually are making investments in nuclear power. It is really 
expensive and difficult to develop, but the investments are being made. 
That is part of the agenda.
  Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Garamendi).
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I am actually quite amazed that we are 
allowing a political ideology to get in the way of reality and facts.
  The fact of the matter is that the U.S. military, more than a decade 
ago, noticed that the climate was changing and they needed to address 
it. Also, the fact is that the largest solar and wind energy systems in 
the Nation are in Texas, and Texas is dependent upon those for their 
power when a heat wave arrives.
  Let's be smart here. Let's not let ideology and the fact that we want 
to get into a fight over climate change get in the way of good public 
policy. It is absolutely essential that the military build for the 
future, that they build for resiliency.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will 
be postponed.
  The Chair understands that amendment No. 65 will not be offered.


                Amendment No. 66 Offered by Mr. Davidson

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 66 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of subtitle D of title XVI, insert the 
     following:

     SEC. 16__. EXCLUSIVE MEANS FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE TO 
                   ACQUIRE LOCATION INFORMATION, WEB BROWSING 
                   HISTORY, INTERNET SEARCH HISTORY, AND FOURTH 
                   AMENDMENT-PROTECTED INFORMATION.

       (a) Exclusive Means.--
       (1) Foreign intelligence purposes.--Title I and sections 
     303, 304, 703, 704, and 705 of the Foreign Intelligence 
     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., 1823, 1824, 
     1881b, 1881c, 1881d) shall be the exclusive means by which 
     the Secretary of Defense acquires location information, web 
     browsing history, Internet search history, and Fourth 
     Amendment-protected information of United States persons or 
     persons inside the United States for foreign intelligence 
     purposes.
       (2) Law enforcement purposes.--A warrant obtained by 
     demonstrating probable cause shall be the exclusive means by 
     which the Secretary of Defense acquires location information, 
     web browsing history, Internet search history, and Fourth 
     Amendment-protected information of United States persons or 
     persons inside the United States for law enforcement 
     purposes.
       (b) Third Party.--If the interception, or compelled 
     production, or physical search or seizure of information 
     inside the United States by the Secretary of Defense would 
     require a warrant, court order, or subpoena under law, the 
     Secretary may not obtain that information from a third party 
     in exchange for anything of value without obtaining the 
     warrant, court order, or subpoena that would be required for 
     such interception, compelled production, or physical search 
     or seizure.
       (c) Exception.--Notwithstanding subsection (b), the 
     Secretary of Defense may acquire the types of information 
     specified in subsection (b) in exchange for something of 
     value if--
       (1) the information is aggregated or anonymized in such a 
     way that it cannot reasonably be de-anonymized or otherwise 
     linked to any individual or specific group of individuals; 
     and
       (2) the Secretary does not disclose the information to any 
     Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency or to any 
     other element of the intelligence community, or any official 
     of such an agency or element.
       (d) Definitions.--In this section:
       (1) The term ``Fourth Amendment-protected information'' 
     means information the compelled production of which would 
     require a warrant for law enforcement purposes.
       (2) The term ``location information'' means information 
     derived or otherwise calculated from the transmission or 
     reception of a radio signal that reveals the approximate or 
     actual geographic location of a customer, subscriber, or 
     device.
       (3) The term ``United States person'' has the meaning given 
     that term in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence 
     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801).

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. Davidson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chair, the amendment I have offered would prevent 
the Department of Defense from purchasing data that would otherwise 
require a warrant, court order, or subpoena. The amendment would also 
end unauthorized surveillance practices.
  The government is currently circumventing the Fourth Amendment by 
purchasing location data, internet browsing data, and other sensitive 
information. The so-called data broker loophole is a severe threat to 
the right to privacy in the United States.
  Freedom surrendered is rarely reclaimed, but we must defend our 
Fourth Amendment.
  Government surveillance programs are routinely misused and targeted 
at Americans. The FBI, in fact, admits it conducted 278,000 improper 
searches of American citizens in 2020 alone. If the government can buy 
its way around the Fourth Amendment, there will be few meaningful 
limits on government surveillance.
  We need to pass this amendment. It at least stops the Department of 
Defense from doing that inside the United States of America.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Alabama?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering 
the amendment.
  Ubiquitous commercial data collection and bulk data sales represent a 
privacy concern for all Americans. Companies and governments alike have 
access to once unimaginable amounts of user data through commercial 
channels. This development and the Fourth Amendment questions that come 
with it deserve full consideration.
  I look forward to working with the gentleman on this amendment to 
ensure that these issues are addressed in a manner that does not unduly

        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 583 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, 
H.R. 2670.
  Will the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber) kindly take the 
chair.

                              {time}  0915


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 2670) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2024 
for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military 
construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, 
to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for 
other purposes, with Mr. Stauber (Acting Chair) in the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose on Thursday, 
July 13, 2023, amendment No. 62, printed in House Report 118-142 
offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Burlison), had been 
disposed of.


                 Amendment No. 63 Offered by Mr. Banks

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 63 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:
       At the end of subtitle G of title V, insert the following:

     SEC. 5__. PROHIBITION ON USE OF QUOTAS BASED ON RACE OR 
                   ETHNICITY IN SERVICE ACADEMY ADMISSIONS.

       None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act 
     or otherwise made available for the military service 
     academies for fiscal year 2024 may be used to discriminate or 
     to use quotas in admissions on the basis of race or 
     ethnicity.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. Banks) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the use of funds to 
discriminate on the basis of race and ethnicity in admissions to the 
military service academies.
  Currently, all of the military service academies use race and 
ethnicity as selection criteria for admissions. Not only is this a 
violation of the Constitution, as recently affirmed by the U.S. Supreme 
Court, but it is a violation of the military's longstanding 
meritocratic principles.
  The military service academies are elite universities that train and 
educate the future leaders of our armed services. We need the best and 
the brightest, the most fit cadets and midshipmen, regardless of their 
skin color and ethnicity. To consider immutable characteristics like 
race and ethnicity is blatantly discriminatory.
  For our national security, we must uphold the ideals of our country 
and put hard work, dedication, and service above all.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Washington is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, Mr. Banks' amendment to prohibit our Nation's service 
academies from promoting diverse experiences and backgrounds as part of 
its missions policy will do nothing but weaken our military.
  The Supreme Court recently recognized in its decision to leave 
service academies out of its ruling on affirmative action that our 
academies are not laboratories for ideological gerrymandering. They are 
institutions that are foundational to our national security.
  Our service academies are responsible for providing a higher 
education but also for training our Nation's men and women to serve as 
global leaders. Many graduates will serve in the highest levels of our 
military and government, where success depends on maintaining an open 
mind, building diverse coalitions, and drawing on broad experiences. 
They will lead as part of a military that has never been more diverse, 
more capable, or more lethal. Soon, nearly half of our servicemembers 
will be people of color, but only a fraction serve as officers and even 
a smaller fraction as senior leaders.
  We learned bitter and painful lessons in World War II, Korea, and 
Vietnam, when leaders neither understood nor looked like the formations 
they led.
  It is 2023, not 1952. If my colleagues across the aisle knew more 
about the painful history of this country, perhaps last night one of 
them would not have referred to Black servicemembers as ``colored 
people.''
  Let's not move our country backward. I oppose this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for 
introducing this amendment.
  I think it is a commonsense amendment. Right now, there are all sorts 
of rumors out there that when people are admitted to the service 
academies--who, after all, are going to wind up running our military, 
the one part of our government that cannot fail--preferences are being 
given and they are not always taking the best people that they can.
  I want to point out something that is a little bit offensive about 
this whole diversity thing. Diversity for people like the Democratic 
Party, sadly, is solely determined by your genetics or your DNA or 
where your ancestors were 200 years ago.
  I will give you an example to show the foolishness of it and that the 
real goal here, I think, is to divide Americans.
  If I am one-quarter Peruvian, I can identify as Hispanic. I can 
identify as Hispanic despite the fact I have never spoken a word of 
Spanish and never been south of the border in my life. The people who 
just want to divide America would say that I have a unique perspective 
growing up in a Milwaukee suburb, despite the fact that I am one-
quarter from a different part of the world.
  This is preposterous on its face, and it will inevitably lead to 
division as we are educating our military that they should look at 
people by where their ancestors came from, not as individuals.
  This true racism, which is what it absolutely is because that is how 
they determine which silo you fit into, has to be ripped away from our 
society and the military, in particular.
  The idea that we have different viewpoints because of where our 
ancestors came from despite the fact that we have not been there and 
know nothing of them is preposterous.
  Like I said, in addition to the divisiveness, you are going to wind 
up with people who are not necessarily the best people to lead our 
military. Anybody familiar with military history knows the important 
decisions that have to be made during wartime. We want those decisions 
made by the brightest people we have, not by people who have been 
picked based upon where their DNA was 2,000 years ago.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Kim), the ranking member

[[Page H3582]]

of the Military Personnel Subcommittee.
  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Chair, I want to respond to what was just 
said.
  It is absolutely important that we set straight that diversity does 
not mean we are talking about people who are less qualified. We are not 
talking about reducing standards. We are talking about recognizing one 
part of the decision as one part of many.
  This is not a situation where it is the overriding factor. I agree 
with what Chairman Banks said, which is that we want the best and 
brightest, but what we recognize when it comes to our service 
academies, in particular, is that this is a situation where we are 
trying to also build a force.

  This is not just about an individual. Yes, we want the best and 
brightest, but we also want the most cohesive and effective fighting 
force for our country.
  We recognize we are building an entity where our servicemembers are 
part of something bigger than all of them.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from New Jersey.
  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. I think about this brief that was put forward 
to the Supreme Court that was written by former military officials that 
said: ``The importance of maintaining a diverse, highly qualified 
officer corps has been beyond legitimate dispute for decades. History 
has shown that placing a diverse Armed Forces under the command of 
homogenous leadership is a recipe for internal resentment, discord, and 
violence.''
  This is written by former military leaders who are advising us to 
make sure that we let the military be able to control and be able to 
have the tools they need to build a force that our country needs.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Mast), a real American hero.
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Chair, I am amazed at the bigoted comments I am hearing 
from the other side right now, literally stating that units need to 
look a certain way. There have to be people of certain colors in these 
units. It is purely idiotic. It is dangerous.
  War is not a game. It is always dangerous. It is very often deadly. I 
damn near gave my life for this country, and I can tell you the last 
thing I cared about was the color of the snipers that had my back or 
the color of the medics that were putting tourniquets on each of my 
legs and my left arm when I was injured on the battlefield. It didn't 
matter if they were Black, White, Brown.
  None of that mattered when they were recruited into the military, and 
it didn't matter as they were serving. It has absolutely zero place, 
and you are literally putting the lives of our servicemembers in 
danger. You are concretely saying that units need to look a certain way 
by color.
  I just pose this quick question. I don't know how much time I have 
remaining, but I will bet you all over there can't tell me what my 
background is. Am I part Black? Part Brown? Part White? What am I?
  I yield time to you for a colloquy if you want to answer that. What 
am I?
  The Acting CHAIR. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the 
Chair.
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Chair, I will bet they can't tell me. I hear silence 
because you don't know what I am. You don't know that I am half 
Mexican. You can't look at me and see that, but you believe that units 
should be made up of something that you can't see and that you can't 
ask about. It is idiotic policy and dangerous for our servicemembers, 
and they deserve better from the other side.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would again remind Members to direct 
their remarks to the Chair.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Ryan), vice ranking member of the House Armed Services 
Committee.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for his service.
  Mr. Chair, I rise as a proud graduate of the United States Military 
Academy at West Point and a representative of the academy today. 
Whether my colleagues want to recognize it or not, particularly those 
on the far right, we have an increasingly growing diverse force.
  As Mr. Kim said, unit cohesion, we can all agree, is essential and 
critical, both in the heat of battle and in training and preparation. 
This amendment would unequivocally, as you heard from retired military 
officers across the world, weaken unit cohesion. Even the 
considerably--to be generous--conservative Supreme Court has recognized 
the distinct interests of these service academies in the Court's recent 
decision that came down just a few weeks ago.
  We have made great strides at the academies with a focus and 
bipartisan commitment for decades. West Point has gone from 20 percent 
to 36 percent cadets of minority backgrounds, and the Naval Academy 
from 19 percent to 37 percent, but we still have work to do to achieve 
unit cohesion.
  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple. It ensures our 
military service academies are in line with the Supreme Court's recent 
decision on the unconstitutionality of race-based affirmative action, 
and it strives to uphold the ideals of meritocracy, which is nowhere 
more important than in the United States military.
  Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time remaining.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1 minute remaining.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Chair, today's military leaders are unequivocal in their support 
of diversity and leadership. Joint Chiefs Chairman Milley considers it 
fundamental. Army Chief McConville calls it a crucial competitive 
advantage. Then-Air Force Chief CQ Brown called diversity an 
imperative. Marine Corps Commandant Berger said the core of America's 
strength lies in its diversity.
  The very government assembled here today, in its amicus brief to the 
Supreme Court, characterized a diverse pool of academy graduates as a 
vital interest on which the Nation's future depends.
  The American people expect and demand that our academies are given 
every tool and advantage to train leaders capable of fighting and 
winning our Nation's wars. Make no mistake, diversity is not synonymous 
with less qualified. We want the best. We want the brightest. We need 
the most diverse.

  This amendment attempts to weaken a concept foundational to our 
current and future military supremacy, that diversity translates into 
capability and lethality.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will 
be postponed.

                  Amendment No. 64 Offered by Mr. Roy

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 64 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of subtitle E of title X, insert the following:

     SEC. 10__. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN

       (1) Executive Order 13990, relating to Protecting Public 
     Health and the Environment and Restoring Science To Tackle

     Reduction Act of 2022.
       (7) Executive Order 14096, relating to Revitalizing Our 
     Nation's Commitment to Environmental Justice for All.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Roy) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, we have spent the better part of the last several 
days making clear to the American people that this side of the aisle 
wants to see a Department of Defense that is focused on its core 
mission, defending the United States of America, rather than divvying 
us up by race and dividing us and separating us.
  I rise today to ensure that the Department of Defense is focused on 
its core mission rather than pursuing the political agenda of climate 
change to the detriment of the national security of the United States.
  In 2021, Department of Defense spokesman John Kirby refused to say 
that China is a bigger national security threat to the United States 
than climate change. He called them equally important and said it 
doesn't do any good to make a relative assessment of national security 
issues.
  Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said climate change is an 
existential threat to our Nation's security.
  Next week, Secretary of State John Kerry literally travels to China 
to discuss climate change, not China's increased aggression against 
Taiwan, not its expansion in the Pacific, not its oppression of its 
people, not the fact that they produce two new coal-fired plants per 
week on top of the 1,100 they have while we undermine our national 
security to pursue the climate-fetish agenda of the other side of the 
aisle.
  President Biden's executive orders have served as the catalyst for 
massive reforms at the Department of Defense that compromise national 
security to advance this climate fetish.
  The amendment that I offer would prohibit any of the funding in the 
National Defense Authorization Act, or that flows from that 
authorization, from being used to carry out President Biden's executive 
orders on climate change.
  The Department of Defense's climate adaptation plan includes radical 
proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the expense of our 
warfighting capabilities. According to the plan, the DOD has identified 
climate change as a critical national security issue. It mandates 
environmental justice because why miss an opportunity to push divisive 
ideology?
  The DOD says it will transition to 100 percent carbon-free 
electricity, meaning America's war machine will literally depend on the 
wind and the sun.
  No one, including anyone on this side of the aisle, believes that we 
shouldn't pursue every advantage and technology to harness energy, no 
one. In Texas, we have embraced wind and we have embraced solar, but to 
our detriment when we have interfered with the market and interfered 
with our ability to have energy at our disposal and at our demand. We 
undermine our grid. We undermine our national security. We undermine 
reliability. We cause energy prices to go up.
  In this case, in the context of the National Defense Authorization 
Act, we should not be pursuing this politically motivated climate 
fetishization that undermines our national security.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Three quick points here. First of all, it is interesting. You can go 
back to 2008 and look at John McCain's campaign and, entertainingly, 
Sarah Palin's Vice Presidential statements about how climate change was 
an existential threat, and this was a bipartisan issue where we talked 
about why this was a significant challenge that we needed to address.
  Then, of course, Barack Obama had the audacity to get elected 
President and pursue that agenda, so suddenly it became political.
  I just want to make this very, very clear. The belief here is that 
digging up fossil fuels from below the ground and burning them is bad 
for life, it is bad for the planet, and it will eventually exterminate 
the planet.
  Now, if you want to disagree with that, you want to have a little 
argument about whether or not that is true, we can. I mean, the 
overwhelming majority of scientists seem to agree with that, but let's 
hear the argument. It just kills me to sit here and listen to the other 
side claim that this is a political agenda.
  Now, I understand why they do that, because that skips past the messy 
part of where you have to actually argue the facts and you can just 
dismiss it as politics and everyone robotically goes: Oh, yes, 
politics, that is bad. We can't have that.
  If we can have an actual discussion about this, if you believe, as 
the administration does and as, again, I don't know, 80 percent of the 
scientists believe, that climate change could destroy the fricking 
planet, then it is worth saying that that's a national security threat 
at least equivalent to China.
  Yes, there is the possibility of global nuclear war with China that 
could exterminate the planet, but climate change, the argument is, 
would exterminate the planet, so I think that is worth thinking about.
  Please believe me when I say this is not a political agenda. It is a 
heartfelt belief that we have a distinct problem here that needs to be 
addressed.
  Second: How to address it. Come up with alternative sources of energy 
and make those investments. This is also very important, because even 
if this wasn't destroying the planet, our dependency upon oil has been 
problematic.
  I know there is this fantasy that we are going to become energy 
independent. Nobody is energy independent. Oil is a global marketplace. 
Even if we generate enough energy, we sell it overseas, and Saudi 
Arabia and OPEC therefore have an enormous amount of control over that 
market.
  As I have said over and over again, the true answer to this problem 
is, when gas prices go up, wouldn't it be great to say: That is 
wonderful, but we don't need that, we have other sources of energy to 
go to. Nothing is more important in the military than energy and access 
to it. Wars are started over having access to the energy that you need. 
To say that this doesn't involve national security literally hurts my 
brain. You need these alternatives.
  The last argument is on the market: We will let the market decide. 
The market subsidized the living hell out of the oil industry for 175 
years. They have an enormous advantage. The pipelines, the system, the 
entire thing that was built, was built on our taxpayer dollars. Now, 
what we are saying is if we are going to develop an alternative to 
that, then we are going to have to help that, as we helped nuclear 
energy, and a whole of bunch other different things.
  I don't think I hear the other side complaining about the government 
subsidizing nuclear energy because that fits within their politics.
  If I ask nothing else, could we please just have a rational 
discussion that understands that this is a legitimate policy issue? It 
isn't a fetish. It isn't a political debate. It is the fate of the 
planet and how we manage energy policy, both of which--I am going to 
take a real bold step here--actually impact national security. I 
believe that they do, and I believe that anybody would agree with that 
statement.
  Please, defeat this amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague for basically making 
the case for the very climate fetish that I describe. When he talks 
about the need for energy and its existence for national security, my 
point is having reliable energy. We have to have energy that is 
available and reliable and dependable. That is the whole point.
  My colleague talks about nuclear power. Great. I am waiting with 
bated breath for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to 
embrace and promote and push noncarbon-producing nuclear power.
  We haven't generated a new nuclear power plant since when, the 1970s?

[[Page H3584]]

Georgia isn't even off the ground because of Federal regulation and 
interference.
  The fact is, we are subsidizing and promoting unreliable wind and 
solar while subsidizing the hell out of electric vehicles, and my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to use the Defense 
Department to continue to promote it, when it engaged in crony 
capitalism to enrich a small handful of elitists on the back of the 
hardworking American people while we subsidize China and make ourselves 
reliable on China for their minerals and what they produce.
  It is absolutely astonishing that we would turn over our national 
defense capability to China at this point in time to pursue this 
radical agenda.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I would just note that we 
actually are making investments in nuclear power. It is really 
expensive and difficult to develop, but the investments are being made. 
That is part of the agenda.
  Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Garamendi).
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I am actually quite amazed that we are 
allowing a political ideology to get in the way of reality and facts.
  The fact of the matter is that the U.S. military, more than a decade 
ago, noticed that the climate was changing and they needed to address 
it. Also, the fact is that the largest solar and wind energy systems in 
the Nation are in Texas, and Texas is dependent upon those for their 
power when a heat wave arrives.
  Let's be smart here. Let's not let ideology and the fact that we want 
to get into a fight over climate change get in the way of good public 
policy. It is absolutely essential that the military build for the 
future, that they build for resiliency.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes

  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will

  The Chair understands that amendment No. 65 will not be offered.


                Amendment No. 66 Offered by Mr. Davidson

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 66 
printed in House Report 118-142.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.

     way that it cannot reasonably be de-anonymized or otherwise 
     linked to any individual or specific group of individuals; 
     and
       (2) the Secretary does not disclose the information to any 
     Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency or to any 
     other element of the intelligence community, or any official 
     of such an agency or element.
       (d) Definitions.--In this section:
       (1) The term ``Fourth Amendment-protected information'' 
     means information the compelled production of which would 
     require a warrant for law enforcement purposes.
       (2) The term ``location information'' means information 
     derived or otherwise calculated from the transmission or 
     reception of a radio signal that reveals the approximate or 
     actual geographic location of a customer, subscriber, or 
     device.
       (3) The term ``United States person'' has the meaning given 
     that term in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence 
     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801).

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. Davidson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Chair, the amendment I have offered would prevent 
the Department of Defense from purchasing data that would otherwise 
require a warrant, court order, or subpoena. The amendment would also 
end unauthorized surveillance practices.
  The government is currently circumventing the Fourth Amendment by 
purchasing location data, internet browsing data, and other sensitive 
information. The so-called data broker loophole is a severe threat to 
the right to privacy in the United States.
  Freedom surrendered is rarely reclaimed, but we must defend our 
Fourth Amendment.
  Government surveillance programs are routinely misused and targeted 
at Americans. The FBI, in fact, admits it conducted 278,000 improper 
searches of American citizens in 2020 alone. If the government can buy 
its way around the Fourth Amendment, there will be few meaningful 
limits on government surveillance.
  We need to pass this amendment. It at least stops the Department of 
Defense from doing that inside the United States of America.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Alabama?
  There was no objection.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering 
the amendment.
  Ubiquitous commercial data collection and bulk data sales represent a 
privacy concern for all Americans. Companies and governments alike have 
access to once unimaginable amounts of user data through commercial 
channels. This development and the Fourth Amendment questions that come 
with it deserve full consideration.
  I look forward to working with the gentleman on this amendment to 
ensure that these issues are addressed in a manner that does not unduly 
burden the Department of Defense relative to the rest of the Federal 
Government while ensuring its operational needs are met.
  I think Congress will spend a substantial amount of time on the 
privacy concerns addressed by this amendment in the coming months, and ",
