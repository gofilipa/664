* the MET API, continued. 
** review: API requests, methods, calls
- discuss the anatomy of an API request
  - root, path, endpoint
  - making the call
- go over some useful methods for working with API data
  - dir(), json(), keys() 
- read over documentation for the MET API
  - search path
  - object path

** review: challenge: search -> object calling
- that number from search corresponds to an object. let's make a new
  search to find it.
- write a new request using f-string, passing that into requests.get
- requests.get, then dir, then json
- save the variable to "first-json", then check some of the keys

** looping through results to make many calls
- we are going to grab a bunch of these, create a dataset of works.
- let's start with the first ten, saving them to a list:
  - get the IDs, make a list.
  - write a loop that prints the first ten
  - group challenge:
    - write a loop that requests the first ten
    - use loop and f strings
    - save to a new list called first 10.
    - must parse and get json before you add to the list.

** adding conditions:
- now, use loops and bracket syntax to examine some of the values
  - cannot access the none values
  - use if &/or item.get()
- now, do it for 100 items
  - individual challenge: google how to add sleep to your loop
    - add sleep = .5
- check out the names, and the genders.
- use f strings to print out both
  - notice anything interesting?
    - only the women have an actual gender. hmmmmm....
    - why is that?

** preliminary data analysis
- saving to DF, and some basic analysis

** BREAK

** NYT API
