* web scraping part deux
Goals:
- review last week:
- continue practicing writing code to extract and filter through elements
- intro to pandas: saving our data to a spreadsheet
- discussing XML data structures
  - what is xml? 
  - show them the LOC RDF formats, like EAD
  - show them a little bit of your QTE project
- brainstorm interests. 


Review last week
- bs4 and requests
- making the soup object
  - attributes and methods (like .text, .find, .find_all)
- abstraction - multi-step process for doing things to HTML data 
  - scraping all of an element
  - writing loops to get the text, saving it to a list
  - writing conditions to filter out the results

Scrape the translegislation.org website
- build up to the group challenge, which asks them to ID the
  components of each bill card.

Introduction to pandas
- how we save these elements.
  - first we just print them, for each bill card
  - then we save them to a variable
  - then we save them to a list.
  - then we create a dataframe
  - then we save to a CSV
