** what is Jekyll?


** installing pre-requisites: ruby & jekyll

** installing a theme
Choose a theme you like from this page:

Fork the theme by going to the github page, and on the top right,
press "fork".

When you are prompted, be sure to change the name of the respository
to something relevant to your project.

Then, clone the repo to your desktop.

#+begin_src
  cd Desktop
  git clone [insert URL for your theme]
  cd [insert name of theme folder]
#+end_src

Finally, run ~bundle install~ to install the necessary jekyll packages
(called "gems") in that folder.

#+begin_src
  bundle install
#+end_src

To generate the website

#+begin_src
  bundle exec jekyll serve
#+end_src

** editing pages

Look inside the folder of your 

There are two pages that you will absolutely need to alter

** creating pages

Create a new file for your page called PAGE-NAME.md, replacing PAGE-NAME with a meaningful filename for the page.

Add the following frontmatter to the top of the file, replacing
PAGE-TITLE with the page's title and URL-PATH with a path you want for
the page's URL. For example, if the base URL of your site is
https://octocat.github.io and your URL-PATH is /about/contact/, your
page will be located at https://octocat.github.io/about/contact.

#+begin_src
  layout: page
title: "PAGE-TITLE"
permalink: /URL-PATH
#+end_src

Below the frontmatter, add content for your page.

** pushing to github pages
[[https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-your-site][See the docs here]]

Navigate to the publishing source for your site. For more information,
see "Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site." For
example, if you chose to publish your site from the docs folder on the
default branch, create and change directories to the docs folder.

#+begin_src
  mkdir docs
  cd docs
#+end_src

Add the github-pages gem by editing the line starting with # gem
"github-pages". Change this line to:

#+begin_src
  gem "github-pages", "~> GITHUB-PAGES-VERSION", group: :jekyll_plugins 
#+end_src

Replace GITHUB-PAGES-VERSION with the latest supported version of the
github-pages gem, which is "232" as of December 2024. Save and close
the file.

Copy and paste all the files in your project folder into the "docs"
folder.

Then, you'll have to build your gems once again, since you've just
just added a new gem for github pages.

#+begin_src
  bundle install
#+end_src
