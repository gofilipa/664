* python 2: lists to logic
Agenda
- review last week's lessons on Python 1
- review challenge
- lessons for today: lists, loops, logic!
- start working with CSV module

** review
- data types,
  - what are they?
  - how do we check them?
- we save data by creating variables
- lists
  - list indexing vs slicing
- methods vs functions
  - functions are independant
  - methods depend on objects (also called properties, attributes)
  - can tell in syntax


** lists
List methods
- list methods
  - what are they?
  - append, remove, pop, sort

Individual challenge, 5min:
- lookup how to use ~insert()~ method
- how is this different from other methods we've tried?
- compare with Python docs. Notice the way that documentation tends to
  be written

** loops
How we do things to data.
- types of data for categorizing data; variables for saving data; how
  to work with lists of data; now, how to do things to
  lists/groupings.
  - also works with strings
- syntax: for item in collection: print(item).
  - practice with both lists and strings
- a note on variable names:
  - the variable following "for" is assigned on the fly

Individual challenge:
- write a loop that counts the number of words in a paragraph.
  - You'll need to set up a "counter" variable, to keep track of the
    numbers. Set the initial value of "counter" to 0.
  - You'll need to read about the += operator in python.

String Methods
- how to do things to strings within loops
- 'HELLO'.lower()
- make a list of cities, and make them all lowercasee
- now save that list to a new list, an empty list
  - why would we want to do this?

Group challenge:
- list of prime numbers and their squares, using f strings.

** logic
Boolean data
- true or false
- operators, look them up. Many different kinds.
- if statement for checking age
  - multiple conditions

Combining loops with logic:
- going back to the first bit of text, check the loop for the word
  "refuse"
- if it contains the word "refuse" we will append it to the new list

** csv module
- csv module
  - what is a module? a collection of code for doing something, in
    this case, for opening csv files
  - read a little of the docs on CSV module, reader

- printing rows from csv on [[https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Enforcement-Actions-Board-Determinations-and-Penal/xrxs-qn95/about_data][Campaign Violations]]:
  - check the type of data(s)
  - how do we access info from different types?

Combining logic, loops, and csv:
- search for a specific candidate name in the dataset
- print out all rows containing that candidate's name
- advanced: print out only the date and the violation

  

** next week: web scraping!
