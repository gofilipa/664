# introduction to git

The purpose of `git` (and VCS generally) is to track changes so that
one can more easily manange their own projects and collaborate with
others. Version control means we can keep track of who does what in a
project, and revert files to previous forms (this is super useful in
software development, where minor changes in code can break an entire
app!).
